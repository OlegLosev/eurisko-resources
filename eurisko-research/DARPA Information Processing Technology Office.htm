The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) often selects its 
research efforts through the Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) process.  
The BAA will be posted directly to FedBizOpps.gov, the single government
 point-of-entry (GPE) for Federal government procurement opportunities 
over $25,000.  The following information is for those wishing to respond
 to the Broad Agency Announcement. 
</p><p align="left">
The DARPA Information Technology Processing Office (IPTO) is soliciting 
innovative research proposals in the area of information technology for a
 new class of cognitive systems that can be characterized simply as 
follows: a cognitive system is one that, among other things,

</p><ol type="disc">
<li>can reason in a variety of ways, using substantial amounts of appropriately represented knowledge; 
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>can learn from its experiences so that its performance improves as it accumulates knowledge and experience; 
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>can explain itself and can accept direction; 
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>can be aware of its own behavior and reflect on its own capabilities; and 
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>can respond in a robust manner to surprises.   
</li></ol>

Architecturally, a cognitive information processing system is likely to 
comprise three types of processes: reactive processes, where system 
responses are provided with low latency in direct response to inputs; 
deliberative processes, where planning and other reasoning processes are
 carried out, including those that deal thoughtfully with natural 
language and other forms of communication; and reflective processes that
 operate based on observations made about the system itself.  Complete 
and capable cognitive information processing systems and their 
underlying processes are likely to be implemented in some combination of
 novel software and hardware, and are further likely to be augmented 
with memories of various sorts (long-term, short-term, etc.) and with 
associated modules for perception and taking action, as appropriate for 
the end application.   Given their abilities to process knowledge and to
 reflect on their own behavior, cognitive systems might be best 
characterized as <i>systems that know what they are doing</i>.   
<p align="left">
Despite enormous gains in raw computational power over the last two 
decades, it is increasingly clear that a revolution in computing 
foundations is necessary to address the problems of the 21st century.  
Semiconductor technologists have been doubling the number of transistors
 on a chip roughly every 18 months (a phenomenon popularly known as 
“Moore’s Law”).  While there is concern that physical limits of this 
consistent growth will soon be reached, excellent research continues to 
be done looking for ways to extend Moore’s Law beyond apparent physical 
limitations, and it seems that with some confidence, we can project that
 in our lifetimes we will be able to build integrated systems with 
roughly the number of computing elements that there are in the brains of
 primates.  But there is nothing to indicate that we are on a path to 
harnessing this raw computing power in the powerful ways that brains do.
  Critical research must be done to determine how to take advantage of 
huge numbers of computing elements to produce intelligent processing of 
the sort that we would call “cognitive.” Since the real power of human 
information processing seems to come from higher level capabilities that
 use abstraction, mental simulation and planning, hypothetical 
reasoning, powerful language understanding and generation capabilities, 
and self-awareness, without an understanding of the architecture for 
doing such things, no amount of pure computational power will afford us 
the kind of intelligent computation that we need to face new problems.  
 
</p><p align="left">
Perhaps equally telling is the fact that as each new generation of 
processor allows us to create larger, more complex systems, we are 
increasingly being defeated by that complexity.  Even the non-scientist 
knows that the excitement of a new PC wears off quickly as its enormous 
new hard disk gets eaten up faster than before, and its blazingly fast 
new processor gets bogged down with all the new features that the 
computing power tempts us to implement.  As systems get larger and more 
complex, there is evidence that utility and productivity are 
increasingly falling off the curve that tracks pure processor size and 
speed.  It has become more difficult to program leading-edge 
high-performance systems (e.g., parallel processors), and the costs of 
programming and maintaining large software systems are growing at 
alarming rates.  The raw power that has so seductively invited us to 
build systems of unprecedented size and complexity has led to systems 
that are dauntingly difficult to debug and test (thus stretching out 
delivery times), regularly fail in practice, and are increasingly 
vulnerable to attack.  It is evident that investing in more of the same 
will simply not get us where we need to go.   
</p><p align="left">
Substantial change in perspective is necessary to achieve a quantum leap
 in the robustness, security, and functional capabilities of DoD-scale. 
 The focus of our new direction in IPTO is on ways to make systems not 
simply faster and smaller, but smarter.  By taking seriously the notions
 of reasoning and learning, as well as other aspects of cognitive 
information processing, we can anticipate a host of potential benefits. 
 If we could truly build systems capable of practical reasoning, 
learning, and self-awareness, we would expect that such systems would be
 easier to extend and maintain.  For example, we might describe in 
natural terms a desired extension, and the system would engage us in a 
dialogue to make sure the right new functionality were created.  The 
system would be aware of its goals and internal state, and in a 
debugging context could directly help us determine where and why its 
behavior strayed from the desired.  Teams of individual cognitive 
systems would be able to coordinate in unprecedented ways; among other 
things, this could eliminate redundancies and gaps in large complex 
systems, and reduce their overall cost.  Intelligent user interfaces 
could adapt to their users, rather than the other way around.   
</p><p align="left">
Cognitive information processing technologies will help us overcome the 
difficulties and limitations of current approaches and will provide 
substantial new opportunities in all sectors, encompassing critical 
defense, industrial and commercial applications.    
</p><p align="left">
There are major research challenges in all areas of cognitive 
information processing technologies.  In the context of an autonomous or
 semi-autonomous cognitive agent, there are a host of capabilities and 
issues of interest; these include perception; representation and 
reasoning; learning; communication and interaction; architectures for 
cognition; and system integration.  We are also interested in robust 
hardware and software infrastructure for building and maintaining 
cognitive systems and networks of systems.  In addition, teams of 
cognitive (and non-cognitive) systems that can be formed dynamically, 
and are well coordinated towards a shared set of goals are of direct 
interest.   Each of these areas has important unsolved problems, for 
example,   
</p><ol type="disc">
<li>What is the most effective coupling between the perceptual and deliberative components of an artificial knowledge-based system? 
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>Given the vast amount of raw information that computers 
sort through almost instantaneously, can the human and animal perceptual
 systems give us insights into how to find important low-frequency 
events in huge amounts of data? 
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>How might an intelligent system use context (physical, 
conversational, experiential, etc.) to help disambiguate complex natural

<p align="left">
</p></li><li>How can plausible but not logically valid reasoning be used
 in a consistent and pragmatic way to get to reasonable conclusions?

<p align="left">
</p></li><li>How might it be possible for a system to help its 
originator in its own debugging?  Does there need to be some reliable

</p></li><li>How might a cognitive system learn the salient things from 
each experience it has and later use what was learned in an appropriate

find the right remembered experiences to apply to each new situation?

</p></li><li>How can we build systems that effectively keep an eye on 
themselves?  How can an artificial reflective system operate in real

All technologies and approaches to enable the creation and 
implementation of advanced cognitive information processing systems with
 significant enhancements in relevant performance metrics are of 
potential interest under this BAA.  Cross-disciplinary approaches that 
combine both innovative hardware and software to create unique 
information processing technologies are also of interest.  Applications 
of these new cognitive systems are also of particular interest, in the 
form of stand-alone systems, mobile platforms, and deeply embedded 
integrated components. 

<p align="left">
<b>GENERAL AREAS OF INTEREST   </b>
</p><p align="left">

<b><u>I.  Computational Perception</u>:</b>  Technologies developed 
under this area of interest will serve as the information processing 
interface between sensors or other interfaces to the external 
environment and the underlying computational processes in a cognitive 
system.   For example, advanced perception technologies could accept 
streaming sensor data from multiple sources, pre-process and fuse the 
data with low latency, extracting information content from noise and 
clutter.  The pre-processed data then could be routed to the proper 
cognitive processes (reflective, deliberative, and reactive).  
Technologies that provide or enable perception from a wide variety of 
data sources and physical sensors are of interest.  There is interest in
 approaches that are high performance, but are relatively less complex 
to implement and for those that are low in power consumption.  Also of 
interest are computational processes that use a cognitive system’s 
knowledge and experience to influence its perceptual capabilities in a 
way that provides revolutionary improvement in its abilities to detect 
important objects, events, and situations in its environment.   
</p><p align="left">

<b><u>II.  Representation and Reasoning</u>:</b>  This area of interest 
seeks to create pragmatically adequate and mathematically well-founded 
knowledge representation formalisms and reasoning processes to support 
the entire range of cognitive information processing demands.  Among 
items of interest are representations for purpose/goals, system 
structure, and behavior, in order to support reflective processes.  
Mechanisms that allow a computational system to reflect on its own 
capabilities and performance and to use such reflection to improve 
performance and solve more difficult problems are of particular 
interest.   
</p><p align="left">

<b><u>III.  Learning</u>:</b>  This area seeks to develop technologies 
for machines that learn that are sufficient for measurable improvements 
of basic functionality through the accumulation of experience.  Of high 
interest are those approaches focused on real-time responses and agents 
with persistent lives that remember where they have been and what they 
have done.   
</p><p align="left">

<b><u>IV.  Communications and Interaction Technology</u>:</b>  This area
 seeks to develop technologies related to advanced interfaces between 
cognitive systems, legacy systems, and humans.  Of special interest are 
capabilities that allow cognitive systems to be instructed, guided, and 
persuaded using natural human-oriented communications (e.g., natural 
language, pictures, gestures).  <br>
Natural, integrated multi-modal technology is important to this thrust. 
 User interfaces that can adapt to the interests and needs of the user, 
either by instruction or by implication, are of interest.   
</p><p align="left">
<b><u>V.  Cognitive Architectures and Integrated Cognitive Agents</u>:</b>
  Systems that integrate the cognitive capabilities of reasoning, 
learning, explaining, ability to be advised, self awareness and robust 
coping with surprise are of interest, especially systems that exhibit 
capabilities substantially beyond those achievable with conventional 
technology.  Significant contributions to the understanding of system 
architectures adequate to produce functional artificial cognitive 
systems are also of interest – we seek innovative ideas, concepts, and 
approaches to determine the most effective machine, information 
processing system, and network architectures for cognition in different 
tasks and contexts.    
</p><p align="left">
<b><u>VI.  Robust Software and Hardware</u>:</b>  This area seeks to 
develop novel software and hardware platforms that facilitate the 
building and operation of robust, secure cognitive systems.  New 
technology for innovative fault-tolerant and secure software and 
hardware infrastructure in the context of cognitive systems and teams of
 such systems is of interest.    
</p><p align="left">
This area includes novel design and implementation approaches to extend 
cognitive systems technology to a broad user base and the development of
 associated test beds, distributed software/hardware elements and data 
sets to validate and extend emerging concepts.    
</p><p align="left">
Approaches that show significant new capability in exploiting the 
current “post-PC” computing opportunities in distributed, pervasive, 
small computing devices.  In addition, this area seeks innovative 
efforts to develop software engineering technologies and software tools 
that support the development of cognitive information processing 
systems.    
</p><p align="left">
<b><u>VII.  Cognitive Teams</u>:</b>  This area seeks innovative ideas 
for creating and managing multi-agent systems that can achieve goals in a
 coordinated way.  Such systems can include multiple artificial 
cognitive agents, humans, and non-cognitive components.  Technology that
 facilitates successful performance of ad hoc teams or networks is of 
interest.  We are also interested in how systems of components can be 
integrated to realize cognition across a distributed team.  Also of 
interest are methods to optimize performance across the entire 
multi-agent system.   
</p><p align="left">
<b><u>VIII. Underlying Foundations</u>:</b>  This area seeks to 
establish fundamental scientific and mathematical foundations for 
cognitive computing areas for which none exist or where those that do 
are inadequate.  Of interest are methods for establishing and assuring 
trust in cognitive systems; significantly better measures of system-wide
 robustness; significantly better understanding of accountability in a 
cognitive systems context; and a firm foundation for artificial 
reflective systems.  Also of interest are technologies for 
biologically-inspired computing, especially those that will create a 
radical change in the underlying information processing substrate that 
is better matched to cognitive computing than the standard Von Neumann 
model.  Of  interest are integrated approaches that include appropriate 
elements of neuroscience and neural systems, semiconductor 
implementations, and realizable architectures.   
</p><p align="left">
<b>PROGRAM SCOPE</b>    
</p><p align="left">
Proposed research should investigate innovative approaches and 
techniques that lead to or enable revolutionary advances in the 
state-of-the-art.  Proposals are not limited to the specific strategies 
listed above, and alternative visions will be considered.  However, 
proposals should be for research that substantially contributes towards 
the goals stated.  Research should result in prototype hardware and/or 
software demonstrating integrated concepts and approaches. Specifically 
excluded is research that primarily results in evolutionary improvement 
to the existing state of practice or focuses on a specific system or 
solution.  Integrated solution sets embodying significant technological 
advances are strongly encouraged over narrowly defined research 
endeavors.  Separate proposal should be submitted for areas that are 
disjointed. Proposals may involve other research groups or industrial 
cooperation and cost sharing.    
</p><p align="left">
<b>SUBMISSION PROCESS </b> 
</p><p align="left">
The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency/Information Processing Technology Office (DARPA/IPTO) requires completion of a <b>Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) Cover Sheet Submission</b> for each Abstract/Proposal, by accessing the URL below:   
</p><p align="left">
</p><center><b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070128083125/http://www.darpa.mil/leaving.asp?url=http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-21">http://www.dyncorp-is.com/BAA/index.asp?BAAid=02-21</a></b></center>
<p align="left">
After finalizing the <b>BAA Cover Sheet Submission</b>, the proposer must print the <b>BAA Confirmation Sheet</b> that will automatically appear on the web page.  Each proposer is responsible for printing the BAA Confirmation Sheet and <u>attaching it</u>
 to the "original" and each copy.  The Confirmation Sheet should be the 
first page of the Abstract/Proposal.  If a proposer intends on 
submitting more than one Abstract/Proposal, a unique UserId and password
 should be used in creating each BAA Cover Sheet.  Failure to comply 
with these submission procedures may result in the submission not being 
evaluated.   
</p><p align="left">
In order to minimize unnecessary effort in proposal preparation and review, proposers are <u>strongly encouraged</u> to submit proposal abstracts, in advance of full proposals.    
</p><p align="left">
<b>ABSTRACT FORMAT </b>
</p><p align="left">

Proposers must submit an original and <b>4</b> copies of the full proposal <i>and</i> <b>2</b>
 electronic copies (i.e., 2 separate disks) of the full proposal (in PDF
 or Microsoft Word 2000 for IBM-compatible format on one 3.5-inch floppy
 disk or one 100 MB Iomega Zip disk).  Each disk must be clearly labeled
 with BAA 02-21, proposer organization, proposal title (short title 
recommended) and “Copy <n> of 2”.  BAA 02-21, <b>Cognitive Information Processing Technology</b> will remain open until 12:00 NOON (EST) <b>Friday, June 6, 2003</b>.
  Thus, proposals may be submitted at any time from issuance of this BAA
 through Friday, June 6, 2003.  Proposers should keep in mind that the 
likelihood of funding is reduced as fiscal year ceilings are reached.  
DARPA will acknowledge receipt of submissions and assign control numbers
 that should be used in all further correspondence regarding proposals. 
  
</n></p><p align="left">
DARPA will attempt to review proposal abstracts within 30 days after 
receipt, and will make a recommendation encouraging or discouraging 
formal proposal submissions.  Proposal abstracts will be reviewed as 
they are received.  Early submissions are strongly encouraged.    
Regardless of the recommendation, the decision to propose is the 
responsibility of the proposer.  All submitted proposals will be fully 
reviewed, regardless of the disposition of the proposal abstract.  
</p><p align="left">
The typical proposal should express a consolidated effort in support of 
one or more technical topic areas.  Disjointed efforts should not be 
included in a single proposal.   
</p><p align="left">
Restrictive notices notwithstanding, proposals may be handled for 
administrative purposes by support contractors.  These support 
contractors are prohibited from competition in DARPA technical research 
and are bound by appropriate non-disclosure requirements. Input on 
technical aspects of the proposals may be solicited by DARPA from 
non-Government consultants /experts who are also bound by appropriate 
non-disclosure requirements.  However, non-Government technical 
consultants/experts will not have access to proposals that are labeled 
by their offerors as “Government Only”.   Use of non-government 
personnel is covered in FAR 37.203(d). 
</p><p align="left">
<b>EVALUATION AND FUNDING PROCESSES  </b> 
</p><p align="left">
Proposals will not be evaluated against each other, since they are not 
submitted in accordance with a common work statement.  DARPA's intent is
 to review proposals as soon as possible after they arrive; however, 
proposals may be reviewed periodically for administrative reasons.  For 
evaluation purposes, a proposal is the document described in PROPOSAL 
FORMAT Section I and Section II (see below).  Other supporting or 
background materials submitted with the proposal will be considered for 
the reviewer's convenience only and not considered as part of the 
proposal.   
</p><p align="left">
Evaluation of proposals will be accomplished through a scientific review
 of each proposal using the following criteria, which are listed in 
descending order of relative importance:   
</p><p align="left">

</p><ol type="1">
<li>Overall Scientific and Technical Merit:  The overall scientific and 
technical merit must be clearly identifiable and compelling.  The 
technical concept should be clearly defined, developed and defensibly 
innovative.    Emphasis should be placed on the technical excellence of 
the development and experimentation approach.   
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>Innovative Technical Solution to the Problem:  Proposed 
efforts should apply new or existing technology in an innovative way 
such as is advantageous to the objectives.  The plan on how offeror 
intends to get developed technology artifacts and information to the 
user community should be considered.  The offeror shall specify 
quantitative experimental methods and metrics by which the proposed 
technical effort’s progress shall be measured. 
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>Potential Contribution and Relevance to DARPA/IPTO Mission:
  The offeror must clearly address how the proposed effort will meet the
 goals of the undertaking and how the proposed effort contributes to 
significant advances to the DARPA/IPTO mission.    
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>Offeror's Capabilities and Related Experience:  The 
qualifications, capabilities, and demonstrated achievements of the 
proposed principals and other key personnel for the primary and 
subcontractor organizations must be clearly shown.   
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>Plans and Capability to Accomplish Technology Transition:  
The offeror should provide a clear explanation of how the technologies 
to be developed will be transitioned to capabilities for military 
forces.  Technology transition should be a major consideration in the 
design of experiments, particularly considering the potential for 
involving potential transition organizations in the experimentation 
process.   
<p align="left">
</p></li><li>Cost Realism:  The overall estimated cost to accomplish the
 effort should be clearly shown as well as the substantiation of the 
costs for the technical complexity described.    Evaluation will 
consider the value to Government of the research and the extent to which
 the proposed management plan will effectively allocate resources to 
achieve the capabilities proposed.  Cost is considered a substantial 
evaluation criterion but is secondary to technical excellence. 
</li></ol>

The Government reserves the right to select for award all, some, or none
 of the proposals received.  Proposals identified for funding may result
 in a contract, grant, cooperative agreement, or other transaction

</p></li><li>Critical technical barriers (i.e., technical limitations that have, in the past, prevented achieving the proposed results).
<p>
</p></li><li>Main elements of the proposed approach.  
<p>
</p></li><li>Rationale that builds confidence that the proposed approach
 will overcome the technical barriers.  ("We have a good team and good 
technology" is not a useful statement.)  
<p>
</p></li><li>Nature of expected results (unique/innovative/critical 
capabilities to result from this effort, and form in which they will be 
defined).
<p>
</p></li><li>The risk if the work is not done.  
<p>
</p></li><li>Criteria for scientifically evaluating progress and capabilities on an annual basis.  
<p>
</p></li><li>Cost of the proposed effort for each performance year.

breakdown of all direct costs, including cost by task, with breakdown 
into accounting categories (labor, material, travel, computer, 
subcontracting costs, labor and overhead rates, and equipment), for the 
entire contract and for each Government fiscal year (October 1 – 
September 30).  Where the effort consists of multiple portions that 
could reasonably be partitioned for purposes of funding, these should be
 identified as contract options with separate cost estimates for each.  
 
</p><p>
