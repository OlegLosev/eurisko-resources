			<div class="entry-content">

<p>Back in July 2010 Kerry Howley published a nice <em>New York Times Magazine</em> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/11/magazine/11cryonics-t.html">article</a> <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/07/modern-male-sati.html">on the tensions</a>
 between my wife and I resulting from my choice to do cryonics. The very
 next month, August 2010, is the date when, in Howley’s new and 
already-celebrated book <a href="http://kerryhowley.com/thrown/"><em>Thrown</em></a>, her alter-ego Kit first falls in love with MMA fighting:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Not until my ride home, as I began to 
settle back into my bones and feel the limiting contours of perception 
close back in like the nursery curtains that stifled the views of my 
youth, did it occur to me that I had, for the first time in my life, 
found a way out of this, my own skin. … From that moment onward, the 
only phenomenological project that could possibly hold interest to me 
was as follows: capture and describe that particular state of being to 
which one Sean Huffman had taken me.</p>
<p>I’ve read the book, and also several dozen reviews. Some reviews 
discuss how Kit is a semi-fictional character, and a few mention Kit’s 
pretentiousness and arrogance. Some disagree on if Kit has communicated 
the ecstasy she feels, or if those feelings are worthy of her obsession.
 But all the reviewers seem to take Kit at her word when she says her 
primary goal is to understand the ecstasy she felt in that first 
encounter.</p>
<p>Yet right after the above quote is this:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">And so naturally I began to show up 
places where Sean might show up— the gym where he trained, the bar where
 he bounced, the rented basement where he lived, the restaurants where 
he consumed foods perhaps not entirely aligned with the professed goals 
of an aspiring fighter. I hope it doesn’t sound immodest to say that 
Sean found this attention entirely agreeable.</p>
<p>Kit does the same to another fighter named Eric, and later she gets 
despondent when Erik won’t return her calls. She tracks him down to a 
fight, hugs him in front of the crowd, and is delighted get his 
acceptance:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">My moment of embarrassment had already transformed into a glow of pride. The entire room saw that I was his, and he mine.</p>
<p>While Kit only feels ecstasy during an actual fight, she spends all 
her time as a “groupie” to two fighters, Sean and Erik. (She says she is
 a “space-taker”, not “groupie”, but I couldn’t see the difference.) Kit
 mainly only goes to fights when these&nbsp;men fight, even when such 
fights are months apart. Kit’s ego comes to depend heavily on getting 
personal attention from these fighters, and her interest in them rises 
and falls with their fighting success. The book ends with her latching 
on to a new fighter, after Sean and Erik have fallen.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if Kit had wanted mainly to study her feeling of 
ecstasy while watching fights, she would have gone to lots of fights, 
and tried to break her feelings down into parts, or looked at how they 
changed with context. She could have also talked to and studied other 
fighter fans, to break down their feelings or see how those change with 
context. But Kit instead sought to hang with successful fighters between
 fights, when neither she nor they felt this ecstasy she said was her 
focus. She didn’t even talk with fighters much about their ecstasy 
feelings. What mattered most to Kit apparently was&nbsp;that fighters 
associated with her, and that they won fights.</p>
<p>Kit quits her philosophy program:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I knew what they would turn my project 
into, these small scholastics with their ceaseless referencing of better
 men would, if they even allowed my explorations as a subject of 
dissertation, demand a dull tome with the tiniest flicker of insight 
buried underneath 800 pages of exegeses of other men’s work. Instead of 
being celebrated as a pioneer of modern phenomenology, I would merely be
 a footnote in the future study of Schopenhauer, whom, without my 
prodding, no one would study in the future.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Kit is self-deceived. She thinks she wants to 
study ecstasy, but in fact she is simply star-struck. The “ecstasy” 
feeling that hit her so hard was her subconscious being very impressed 
with these fighters, and wanting badly to associate with them. And she 
felt very good when she succeeded at that. By associating with their 
superiority, she could also feel feel superior to the rest of the world:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I would write my fighterly thesis, but I 
would not fraternize with the healthy-minded; better to leave them to 
their prenatal yoga, their gluten-free diets, their dull if long lives 
of quietest self-preserving conformism.</p>
<p>Of course Kerry Howley, the author, does not equal Kit, the voice 
Kerry chooses to narrate&nbsp;her book. Kerry may well be very aware of 
Kit’s self-deception, but still found Kit a good vehicle for 
painting&nbsp;an intimate portrait of the lives of some fighters. But if
 so, I find it odd that none of the other dozens of reviews I’ve read of
 <em>Thrown</em> mention this.</p>
<p><strong>Added 21Oct</strong>: Possible theories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most reviewers read the book carefully, but are too stupid to notice.</li>
<li>Most reviewers are lazy &amp; only skimmed the book.</li>
<li>Reviewers hate to give negative reviews, &amp; this sounds negative.</li>
<li>Readers crave idealistic narrators, and reviewers pander to readers.</li>
<li>My reading is all wrong.</li>

<p>After <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/10/em-software-engineering-bleg.html">requesting</a>
 your help, I should tell you what it added up to. The following&nbsp;is
 an excerpt from my book draft, illustrated by this diagram:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/SoftwareIntensity.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30920" src="Overcoming%20Bias_files/SoftwareIntensity.jpg" alt="SoftwareIntensity" height="353" width="500"></a></p>
<p>In our world, the cost of computing hardware has been falling rapidly
 for decades. This fall has forced most computer projects to be short 
term, so that products can be used before they are made obsolete. The 
increasing quantity of software purchased has also led to larger 
software projects, which involve more engineers. This has shifted the 
emphasis toward more communication and negotiation, and also more 
modularity and standardization in software styles.</p>
<p>The cost of hiring human software engineers has not fallen much in 
decades. The increasing divergence between the cost of engineers and the
 cost of hardware has also lead to a decreased emphasis on raw 
performance, and increased emphasis on tools and habits that can quickly
 generate correct if inefficient performance. This has led to an 
increased emphasis on modularity, abstraction, and on high-level 
operating systems and languages. High level tools insulate engineers 
more from the details of hardware, and from distracting tasks like type 
checking and garbage collection. As a result, software is less efficient
 and well-adapted to context, but more valuable overall. An increasing 
focus on niche products has also increased the emphasis on modularity 
and abstraction.</p>
<p>Em software engineers would be selected for very high productivity, 
and use the tools and styles preferred by the highest productivity 
engineers. There would be little interest in tools and methods 
specialized to be useful “for dummies.” Since em computers would tend to
 be more reversible and error-prone, em software would be more focused 
on those cases as well. Because the em economy would be larger, its 
software industry would be larger as well, supporting more 
specialization.</p>
<p>The transition to an em economy would greatly lower wages, thus 
inducing a big one-time shift back toward an emphasis on raw 
context-dependent performance, relative to abstraction and easier 
modifiability. The move away from niche products would add to this 
tendency, as would the ability to save copies of the engineer who just 
wrote the software, to help later with modifying it. On the other hand, a
 move toward larger software projects could favor more abstraction and 
modularity.</p>
<p>After the em transition, the cost of em hardware would fall at about 
the same speed as the cost of other computer hardware. Because of this, 
the tradeoff between performance and other considerations would change 
much less as the cost of hardware fell. This should greatly extend the 
useful lifetime of programming languages, tools, and habits matched to 
particular performance tradeoff choices.</p>
<p>After an initial period of large rapid gains, the software and 
hardware designs for implementing brain emulations would probably reach 
diminishing returns, after which there would only be minor improvements.
 In contrast, non-em software will probably improve about as fast as 
computer hardware improves, since algorithm gains in many areas of 
computer science have for many decades typically remained close to 
hardware gains. Thus after ems appear, em software engineering and other
 computer-based work would slowly get more tool-intensive, with a larger
 fraction of value added by tools. However, for non-computer-based tools
 (e.g., bulldozers) their intensity of use and the fraction of value 
added by such tools would probably fall, since those tools probably 
improve less quickly than would em hardware.</p>
<p>For over a decade now, the speed of fast computer processors has 
increased at a much lower rate than the cost of computer hardware has 
fallen. We expect this trend to continue long into the future. In 
contrast, the em hardware cost will fall with the cost of computer 
hardware overall, because the emulation of brains is a very parallel 
task. Thus ems would see an increasing sluggishness of software that has
 a large serial component, i.e., which requires many steps to be taken 
one after the other, relative to more parallel software. This 
sluggishness would directly reduce the value of such software, and also 
make such software harder to write.</p>
<p>Thus over time serial software will become less valuable, relative to
 ems and parallel software. Em software engineers would come to rely 
less on software tools with a big serial component, and would instead 
emphasize parallel software, and tools that support that emphasis. Tools
 like automated type checking and garbage collection would tend to be 
done in parallel, or not at all. And if it ends up being too hard to 
write parallel software, then the value of software more generally may 
be reduced relative to the value of having ems do tasks without software
 assistance.</p>
<p>For tasks where parallel software and tools suffice, and where the 
software doesn’t need to interact with slower physical systems, em 
software engineers could be productive even when sped up to the top 
cheap speed. This would often make it feasible to avoid the costs of 
coordinating across engineers, by having a single engineer spend an 
entire subjective career creating a large software system. For an 
example, an engineer that spent a subjective century at one million 
times human speed would be done in less than one objective hour. When 
such a short delay is acceptable, parallel software could be written by a
 single engineer taking a subjective lifetime.</p>
<p>When software can be written quickly via very fast software 
engineers, product development could happen quickly, even when very 
large sums were spent. While today investors may spend most of their 
time tracking current software development projects, those who invest in
 em software projects of this sort might spend most of their time 
deciding when is the right time to initiate such a project. A software 
development race, with more than one team trying to get to market first,
 would only happen if the same sharp event triggered more than one 
development effort.</p>
<p>A single software engineer working for a lifetime on a project could 
still have troubles remembering software that he or she wrote decades 
before. Because of this, shorter-term copies of this engineer might help
 him or her to be more productive. For example, short-term em copies 
might search for and repair bugs, and end or retire once they have 
explained their work to the main copy. Short-term copies could also 
search among many possible designs for a module, and end or retire after
 reporting on their best design choice, to be re-implemented by the main
 copy. In addition, longer-term copies could be created to specialize in
 whole subsystems, and younger copies could be revived to continue the 
project when older copies reached the end of their productive lifetime. 
These approaches should allow single em software engineers to create far
 larger and more coherent software systems within a subjective lifetime.</p>
<p>Fast software engineers who focus on taking a lifetime to build a 
large software project, perhaps with the help of copies of themselves, 
would likely develop more personal and elaborate software styles and 
tools, and rely less on tools and approaches that help them to 
coordinate with other engineers with differing styles and uncertain 
quality. Such lone fast engineers would require local caches of relevant
 software libraries. When in distantly separated locations, such caches 
could get out of synch. Local copies of library software authors, 
available to update their contributions, might help reduce this problem.
 Out of synch libraries would increase the tendency toward divergent 
personal software styles.</p>
<p>When different parts of a project require different skills, a lone 
software engineer might have different young copies trained with 
different skills. Similarly, young copies could be trained in the 
subject areas where some software is to be applied, so that they can 
better understand what variations will have value there.</p>
<p>However, when a project requires different skills and expertise that 
is best matched to different temperaments and minds, then it may be 
worth paying extra costs of communication to allow different ems to work
 together on a project. In this case, such engineers would likely 
promote communication via more abstraction, modularity, and higher level
 languages and module interfaces. Such approaches also become more 
attractive when outsiders must test and validate software, to certify 
its appropriateness to customers. Enormous software systems could be 
created with modest sized teams working at the top cheap speed, with the
 assistance of many spurs. There may not be much need for even larger 
software teams.</p>
<p>The competition for higher status among ems would tend to encourage 
faster speeds than would otherwise be efficient. This tendency of fast 
ems to be high status would tend to raise the status of software 
engineers.</p>

<p>I’ve long puzzled&nbsp;over differing&nbsp;interest in history 
and&nbsp;the future, in both fiction and non-fiction. And I’ve finally 
collected some&nbsp;numbers.</p>
<p>Amazon.com says it has 37 million books on offer. Here&nbsp;are the 
fraction of those books it says are in&nbsp;these&nbsp;named categories:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AmazonCategories.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30916" src="Overcoming%20Bias_files/AmazonCategories.jpg" alt="AmazonCategories" height="248" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Note that Amazon has no “future studies” category, so I listed the 
two future-themed categories I found. Here are the fraction of books 
associated with related&nbsp;keyword phrases:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/AmazonKeyword.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-30917" src="Overcoming%20Bias_files/AmazonKeyword.jpg" alt="AmazonKeyword" height="267" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Why the far larger interest in real history, relative to all the 
other combinations of future/history and real/fictional? It can’t just 
be a simple history vs. future effect, nor a real vs fiction effect – it
 is some sort of combination effect.</p>

<p>Older women often&nbsp;find themselves too old to have kids, and regretting it. Such women would have gained&nbsp;by <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/11/get-eggs-froze.html">freezing</a>
 some eggs when they were younger. But when younger, they 
didn’t&nbsp;think they’d ever want kids, or thought the issue could 
wait.</p>
<p>Such women might&nbsp;be helped&nbsp;by an egg futures business, 
paid&nbsp;to take on this risk for them. Such a business could buy eggs 
from women&nbsp;when young, freeze them, and sell them&nbsp;back to 
these same women&nbsp;when old.</p>
<p>Of course, to compensate for the wait and risk that the women 
wouldn’t want eggs later, this business would have to&nbsp;sell eggs 
back a high price. But still, if the women bought the egg later, that 
would show they expected&nbsp;to gain&nbsp;from the deal.</p>
<p>Also, not all women would make equally good prospects. So such a 
business would focus on women likely to wait too long, be well off, and 
want kids later. So this business would “discriminate” by class in its 
purchases, paying more to upper class women. A lot&nbsp;like we now 
discriminate when we pay&nbsp;more for used clothes, cars, or houses 
from richer people.</p>
<p>Several people have told me that, while they were not personally 
offended, they expect others to be offended by such a business. 
Especially if men were involved in the business – a female only business
 would offend less. I’m somewhat mystified, which is partly why I’m 
writing this post. Maybe others can help me understand the objection.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we&nbsp;could add some personal&nbsp;prediction 
markets, which would probably be&nbsp;legal. For each possible young 
woman, there could be a market where one buys and sells conditional 
shares in an egg from that customer. If you owned a conditional share, 
you’d own a share of the profit from later selling&nbsp;that customer 
her&nbsp;egg. And you’d owe a share of the cost to buy her&nbsp;egg from
 her, freeze it, and store it.&nbsp;Imagine the fun buying and selling 
conditional shares regarding the young women that you know. And the fact
 that this is a share of a real physical object&nbsp;should make it 
legal.</p>
<p>Ok, I can see how people might be offended at this last suggestion. 
After all, there’s a risk that&nbsp;people&nbsp;might have&nbsp;<em>fun</em> on&nbsp;something that is supposed to be&nbsp;<em>serious</em>! <img src="Overcoming%20Bias_files/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley"></p>

<p>Many software engineers read this blog, and I’d love to include a 
section on software engineering in my book on ems. But as my software 
engineering expertise is limited, I ask you, dear software engineer 
readers, for help.</p>
<p>“Ems” are future brain emulations. I’m writing a book on em social 
implications. Ems would substitute for human workers, and once ems were 
common ems would do almost all work, including software engineering. 
What I seek are reasonable guesses on&nbsp;the tools and patterns of 
work of em software engineers – how their tools and work patterns would 
differ from those today, and how those would vary with time and along 
some key dimensions.</p>
<p>Here are some reasonable premises to work from:</p>
<ol>
<li>Software would be a bigger part of the economy, and a bigger 
industry overall. So it could support more specialization and pay more 
fixed costs.</li>
<li>Progress would have been made in the design of tools, languages, 
hardware, etc. But&nbsp;there’d still be far to go to automate all 
tasks; more income would still go to rent ems than to rent other 
software.</li>
<li>After an initial transition where em wages&nbsp;fall greatly 
relative to human wages, em hardware costs would thereafter fall about 
as fast as non-em computer hardware costs. So the relative cost to rent 
ems and other computer hardware would stay about the same over time. 
This is in stark contrast to today when hardware costs fall fast 
relative to human wages.</li>
<li>Hardware speed will not rise as fast as hardware costs fall. Thus 
the cost advantage of parallel software would&nbsp;continue to rise.</li>
<li>Emulating brains is a much more parallel task than are most software tasks today.</li>
<li>Ems would typically run about a thousand times human mind speed, but
 would vary over a wide range of speeds. Ems in software product 
development races would run much faster.</li>
<li>It would be possible to save a copy of an em engineer who just wrote
 some software, a&nbsp;copy available to answer questions about it, or 
to modify it.</li>
<li>Em software engineers could sketch out a software design, and then 
split into many temporary copies who each work on a different part of 
the design, and talk with each other to negotiate boundary issues. (I 
don’t assume one could merge the&nbsp;copies afterward.)</li>
<li>Most ems are crammed into a few dense cities. Toward em city 
centers, computing hardware is more expensive, and maximum hardware 
speeds are lower. Away from city centers, there are longer communication
 delays.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the key question is: how would em software tools and work 
patterns differ from today’s, and how would they vary with 
time,&nbsp;application, software engineer speed, and city location?</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the kind of conclusions one might be tempted to draw, here are some recent suggestions&nbsp;of <a href="http://fare.livejournal.com/179127.html">François-René Rideau</a>: <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2014/10/em-software-engineering-bleg.html#more-30907" class="more-link">Continue reading "Em Software Engineering Bleg" »</a></p>

<p>Long ago, I first believed in religion as a young kid because I 
believed what I was told. Then I also believed because religious claims 
seemed to explain the strong emotions that religious contexts induced. 
This is how religion works – you feel strong emotions due to candles, 
buildings, clothes, music, well crafted and button-pushing words, 
charismatic empathetic leaders, social support and status. And if 
respected leaders and supporters around you then claim that your 
emotions are caused by God, well that makes sense. Even though many 
religious claims are transparently crazy, at least to people who well 
understand the world, they are easy for the young or inexpert&nbsp;to 
accept.</p>
<p>Recently while watching an emotional movie with political and moral 
overtones, I was reminded that the same is true for art. Art can make us
 feel strong emotions via all the same mechanisms. When high status 
artists and art supporters around us tell us&nbsp;these emotions are 
caused by our recognizing the emotional truth of art’s moral, political,
 and legal claims, that can make sense to us. Yet most of the channels 
by which&nbsp;art makes us feel emotions are irrelevant to the truth of 
its key claims. When we come to see this, we usually make excuses and 
tell ourselves that we aren’t fooled by all that other stuff; we really 
are just evaluating only the key moral/political/legal arguments. But 
the many correlations we see between features of art and who is 
persuaded when make it hard to believe this applies to most people most 
of the time.</p>
<p>The same likely also holds for essays like this one, or academic 
papers. While such writings may contain logical arguments, they also 
transmit writing styles, author charisma, status, and impressiveness, 
and clues about who supports or opposes them. You might think that you 
correct for all those influences when you read such writings and 
evaluate their claims, but the patterns above in religion and art 
suggest this is unlikely. The <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/06/who-wants-accuracy.html">fact</a> <a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2011/07/respect-forecast-accuracy.html">that</a>
 people aren’t very interested in the accuracy of their pundits suggests
 we usually give a&nbsp;high priority to presentation style.</p>
<p>Could we do better? On subjects that have implications for future 
observations we could use&nbsp;prediction markets. But what about other 
subjects? Well, we might try to control for presentation variation by 
having a group of neutral writers rewrite common arguments in a standard
 style. That is, a single neutral writer could present all the different
 arguments on some subject, all using the same writing style. Readers of
 such presentations would have a better chance of drawing conclusions on
 each&nbsp;subject based on the logic of&nbsp;arguments, instead of 
writing styles. The fact that we aren’t very interested in 
these&nbsp;sort of presentations suggests that we aren’t very interested
 in reducing the influence of other writing style related&nbsp;factors.</p>

<p>I was struck by this quote in the paper cited in my last post:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">The biosphere considered as a whole has 
managed to expand the amount of solar energy captured for metabolism to 
around 5%, limited by the nonuniform presence of key nutrients across 
the Earth’s surface — primarily fresh water, phosphorus, and nitrogen. 
Life on Earth is not free-energy-limited because, up until recently, it 
has not had the intelligence and mega-engineering to distribute Earth’s 
resources to all of the places solar energy happens to fall, and so it 
is, in most places, nutrient-limited. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1133">more</a>)</p>
<p>That reminded me of reading earlier this year about how whale poop was once a great nutrient distributor:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A couple of centuries ago, the southern 
seas were packed with baleen whales. Blue whales, the biggest creatures 
on Earth, were a hundred times more plentiful than they are today. 
Biologists couldn’t understand how whales could feed themselves in such 
an iron-poor environment. And now we may have an answer: Whales are 
extraordinary recyclers. What whales consume (which is a lot), they give
 back. (<a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2014/04/03/298778615/the-power-of-poop-a-whale-story">more</a>)</p>
<p>It seems we should save (and expand) the whales because of their huge
 positive externality on other fish. If humans manage to increase the 
fraction of solar energy used by life on Earth, it will be primarily 
because of trade and transport. Transport gives us the ability to move 
lots of nutrients, and trade gives us the incentives to move them.</p>

<p>Whatever else the <a href="http://www.templeton.org/">Templeton Foundation</a> may have done wrong, they have done&nbsp;very right by funding the&nbsp;research behind two new papers, to appear in the <em>Astrophysical Journal.&nbsp;</em>The first paper reviews&nbsp;what evidence of&nbsp;aliens we should expect to see:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We motivate the \^G infrared search for 
extraterrestrial civilizations with large energy supplies. We discuss 
some philosophical difficulties of SETI, and how communication SETI 
circumvents them. We review “Dysonian SETI”, the search for artifacts of
 alien civilizations, and find that it is highly complementary to 
traditional communication SETI; the two together might succeed where 
either one, alone, has not. We discuss the argument of Hart (1975) that 
spacefaring life in the Milky Way should be either galaxy-spanning or 
non-existent, and examine a portion of his argument that we dub the 
“monocultural fallacy”. We discuss some rebuttals to Hart that invoke 
sustainability and predict long Galaxy colonization timescales. We find 
that the maximum Galaxy colonization timescale is actually much shorter 
than previous work has found (<span id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" class="MathJax"><span id="MathJax-Span-1" class="math"><span id="MathJax-Span-2" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-3" class="mo">&lt;</span><span id="MathJax-Span-4" class="msubsup"><span id="MathJax-Span-5" class="mn">10</span><span id="MathJax-Span-6" class="mn">9</span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;yr),
 and that many “sustainability” counter-arguments to Hart’s thesis 
suffer from the monocultural fallacy. We extend Hart’s argument to alien
 energy supplies, and argue that detectably large energy supplies can 
plausibly be expected to exist because life has potential for 
exponential growth until checked by resource or other limitations, and 
intelligence implies the ability to overcome such limitations. As such, 
if Hart’s thesis is correct then searches for large alien civilizations 
in other galaxies may be fruitful; if it is incorrect, then searches for
 civilizations within the Milky Way are more likely to succeed than Hart
 argued. We review some past Dysonian SETI efforts, and discuss the 
promise of new mid-infrared surveys, such as that of WISE. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1133">more</a>)</p>
<p>The second paper describes a plan to look for some key evidence:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We describe the framework and strategy of
 the \^G infrared search for extraterrestrial civilizations with large 
energy supplies, which will use the wide-field infrared surveys of WISE 
and Spitzer to search for these civilizations’ waste heat. We develop a 
formalism for translating mid-infrared photometry into quantitative 
upper limits on extraterrestrial energy supplies. We discuss the likely 
sources of false positives, how dust can and will contaminate our 
search, and prospects for distinguishing dust from alien waste heat. We 
argue that galaxy-spanning civilizations may be easier to distinguish 
from natural sources than circumstellar civilizations (i.e., Dyson 
spheres), although Gaia will significantly improve our capability to 
identify the latter. We present a “zeroth order” null result of our 
search based on the WISE all-sky catalog: we show, for the first time, 
that Kardashev Type III civilizations (as Kardashev originally defined 
them) are very rare in the local universe. More sophisticated searches 
can extend our methodology to smaller waste heat luminosities, and 
potentially entirely rule out (or detect) both Kardashev Type III 
civilizations and new physics that allows for unlimited “free” energy 
generation. (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.1134">more</a>)</p>
<p>I’ll be quite&nbsp;surprised if they see anything, as I find hard to 
believe that, if they have existed nearby for a billion years, aliens 
wouldn’t already be plenty visible in their first result. But the issue 
is plenty important enough to look carefully anyway.</p>

<p>From a wide-ranging <a href="http://cyprus-mail.com/2014/10/01/of-machines-and-men/">profile</a> of me in the Cyprus Mail (a newspaper):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I’ve learned a bit about his lifestyle – 
[Hanson] reads widely; he goes biking; he likes movies, and peruses ‘100
 Best Films’ lists to check how many he’s seen – but not very much. A 
profile is supposed to be personal, I remind him. But he shakes his 
head.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">When interviewers talk to a musician or 
an athlete (or indeed a well-known academic), he points out, they’re 
forever asking them to ‘tell me about the rest of your life’ – yet “the 
way people become famous musicians or athletes is to focus so much of 
their energy on this professional thing, [so] there usually isn’t much 
of a ‘rest of their life’. And that’s not a message people usually want 
to hear, so they make up silly things in order to seem personal.”</p>
