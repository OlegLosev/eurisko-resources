<h3>Project Description</h3>

In his book <i> Proofs and Refutations</i>, Lakatos identifies seven
methods by which mathematical discovery and justification can occur.
These methods suggest ways in which concept definitions, conjectures
and proofs gradually evolve via interaction between
mathematicians. Different mathematicians may have different
interpretations of a conjecture, examples or counterexamples of it,
and beliefs regarding its value or theoremhood. Through discussion,
concepts are refined and conjectures and proofs modified. For
instance, when a counterexample is found, one might look for general
properties which make it fail a conjecture, and then modify the
conjecture by excluding that type of counterexample (piecemeal
exclusion). Alternatively, one might generalise from the positives and
then limit the conjecture to examples of that type (strategic
withdrawal). Another reaction might be to deny that the object is a
counterexample on the grounds that the conjecture refers to objects of
a different type (monster barring). Given a faulty proof, a
counterexample may be used to highlight areas of weakness in the
proof, and to either modify the proof or the conjecture which it
purports to prove (lemma incorporation). <p>


Our main aim was to provide a computational reading of Lakatos's
theory, by interpreting it as a series of algorithms and implementing
these algorithms as a computer program. We hypothesised that this is
<i>(a)</i> possible, and <i>(b)</i> useful. In order to test our
hypotheses we developed a system within which we implemented his
methods: <a href="hrl.html">HRL</a>. This is a multi-agent automated
theory formation programme in which each agent has a copy of Colton's
theory formation system <a
href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sgc/hr/">HR</a>, which can form
concepts and make conjectures which empirically hold for the objects
of interest supplied. The conjectures are communicated to the other
agents, who send counterexamples if they have them. Agents then use
Lakatos's methods to suggest modifications to conjectures, concept
definitions and proofs.<p>
