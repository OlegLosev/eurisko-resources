The system HRL incorporates <a
href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sgc/">Simon Colton</a>'s program <a
href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~sgc/hr/">HR</a>, which is named after
mathematicians Godfrey Harold Hardy (1877 - 1947) and Srinivasa
Aiyangar Ramanujan (1887 - 1920), and extends it by modelling
Lakatos's methods and enabling dialogue between multiple copies of
HR. Thus, the name HRL reflects our debt to HR, and highlights the
importance of the philosopher Imre Lakatos (1922-1974) and the deep
influence of his work on our system.<p>


This runs under java version 4. Unfortunately, it does not currently
run under later versions. Please feel free to <a
href="mailto:alisonp@dai.ed.ac.uk">email</a> me if you have any
queries.<br>

<h3>To download HRL</h3>


Download and unzip <a href="download/classes.tar.gz">class
files.tar.gz</a>, and store in a directory called "classes".<br>

Download and unzip <a href="download/files.tar.gz">files.tar.gz</a>,
and store in a directory called "files". These include both domain
files (.hrd) and macro files (.hrm).<br><br>


Make the following files and store them all in the same directory,
under the same name as given here, in a directory from which both
class and domain files can be read:<br>

<p><i>(i)</i> Download <a
href="download/hr_agency.cfg">hr_agency.cfg</a>. Set the value of
"input files directory" to the files directory above. Make a directory
called "store" and set the "storage directory" field to the store
directory address. Fill in the "name" field. Change the values of the
other fields if necessary.


<p><i>(ii)</i> Download and make executable the files <a
href="download/maketeacher">maketeacher</a> and <a
href="download/makestudent">makestudent</a>.<p>

</td>

<p><i>(iii)</i> Download and make executable the files <a
href="download/agency:1">agency:1</a>, <a
href="download/agency:2">agency:2</a>, <a
href="download/agency:3">agency:3</a>, and <a
href="download/agency:4">agency:4</a>. These are the commands to run
the agency with one, two, three and four students respectively.  Note
that you can run HRL with more students by adding further makestudent
commands to the agency:"n" files.<p>



<h3>To run HRL</h3> 

Go to the directory in which you stored the files <i>(i)</i> hr_agency.cfg,
<i>(ii)</i> maketeacher, makestudent, and <i>(iii)</i> agency:1,
agency:2, agency:3 and agency:4. This directory can also read the
classes and domain files directory.

At the command line, type agency:"n" (for n = 2 to 4). This will set
off "n" copies of HR and a teacher, which will all come up on your
screen.

Load the macros. You need to do this individually for each student and
the teacher. For instance, if you want to run the agency with three
students in animals theory, type agency:3, and then for one student
click on a-mb-animals-S1.hrm at the top of the left hand column, for
another click on a-mb-animals-S2.hrm and for the third click on
a-mb-animals-S3.hrm. For the teacher click on
a-mb-animals-teacher.hrm. Note that you can distinguish student from
the teacher in the title bar. After highlighting the hrm file, click
on the red "play macro" button in the top left hand corner for each
agent: you should see "played macro" at the bottom of the screen. For
the teacher agent click the "start" button on the bottom left hand
corner, and this will start the agency running.


<h3>Reading the results</h3>

During and after the run, go to the Lakatos screen by clicking on the
"Lakatos" button in the bottom left hand corner. This will give you
twelve tabs: up to ten students, the teacher and "group". Under the
relevant tabs type the Agent file into the yellow box: this will be
"8500" for the teacher (omit quotes when you type), "8000" for the
first student, "8100" for the second, 8200 for the third, etc. (the
address would be "8600" for a seventh student). To read the group
file, type "group-file". This will access the file which the students
and the teacher write to during the discussion. You can look at
individual theories, for instance, concepts and definitions, by
clicking on the relevant button along the bottom of the screen for
each student. To end a run, click on the "stop" button on the
teacher's screen. Note that after each run you should delete or move
the files "8000", "8100", etc. and the "group-file" (otherwise the old
files will be read for a new run).


<h3>Examples</h3>

The domain files for these examples are at the top of the left hand
column (just underneath the red button "Play macro").<p>

<b>(1)</b> (in which the platypus is barred)<br>

Run agency:3 and load the domain files:<br>
a-mb-animals-S1.hrm<br>
a-mb-animals-S2.hrm<br>
a-mb-animals-S3.hrm<br>
a-mb-animals-teacher.hrm<br>
in the first, second, third student and teacher, respectively.<p>

<b>(2)</b> (in which the students have different ideas of what constitutes a
group)<br>
Run agency:3 and load the domain files:<br>
a-mb-gt-S1.hrm<br>
a-mb-gt-S2.hrm<br>
a-mb-gt-S3.hrm<br>
a-mb-teacher.hrm<br>
in the first, second, third student and teacher, respectively.<p>

<b>(3)</b> (in which Goldbach's conjecture is generated, given the
main concepts in it)<br>

Run agency:2 and load the domain files:<br>
a-mb-nt-S1.hrm<br>
a-mb-nt-S2.hrm<br>
a-nt-teacher.hrm<br>
in the first, second student and teacher, respectively.
