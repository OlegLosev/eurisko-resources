In the paper ``Refactorable Numbers - A Machine Invention'', we tried
to make two points: (i) that the HR program we have implemented can
invent new and interesting concepts in number theory and (ii) that one
concept output by HR, namely the refactorable numbers, had many
interesting properties. Because refactorables and associated sequences
were missing from the encyclopedia of integer sequences, <a href="#sloane">[5]</a>, and after a preliminary search of the relevant
literature, we concluded that the refactorable numbers were a
genuinely new invention.
</p><p align="justify">
However, on 23rd March 1999, we received notification from
 <a href="http://www.math-cs.cmsu.edu/%7Erkennedy/rkennedy.html">Robert
Kennedy</a> and <a href="http://www.math-cs.cmsu.edu/%7Erkennedy/ccooper.html">Curtis
Cooper</a>, of Central Missouri State University, that they had read
the above paper and that the concept of refactorables had been defined
already as `tau numbers' in a 1990 paper, <a href="#kennedy">[2]</a>,
which proved that the natural density of the tau numbers is zero.
</p><p align="justify">
This news detracts from our original paper in only one way, namely
that the title is inaccurate, refactorables were a machine
re-invention. Indeed, the news that they have been developed so
recently adds both to the point that HR can invent and re-invent
concepts of interest and, of course, to the point that refactorables
are interesting.

</p><p align="justify">
To add to the argument that HR produces interesting, novel concepts in
number theory, we present the following very simple function defined
by HR recently:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>f(n) = |{(a,b) : a*b=n &amp; a|b}|.</i>
</center>
<p>
This has been added to the encyclopedia:

<hr>

<p align="justify">
This was interesting because of its similarity to the tau function,
[<a href="http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi/?Anum=000005">A000005</a>]:
(<i>tau(n) = </i> number of divisors of <i>n</i>). HR went on to
define the integer sequence of numbers which set a record for <i>f</i>
(ie. those integers, <i>a</i>, for which for all <i>b, 0 &lt; b &lt; a, f(a)
&gt; f(b)</i>): <br><br>

It was easy to spot that these are all square numbers, but a little
investigating turned up this interesting result:
</p><p align="justify">
<b>Theorem 1.</b> The nth integer setting the record for <i>f</i> as
above is the square of the nth highly composite number [<a href="http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi/?Anum=002182">A002182</a>] (the highly composite
numbers have more divisors than any smaller integer).
</p><p align="justify">
To prove this, we need the following lemma:
</p><p align="justify">
<b> Lemma 1.</b> <i>f(n) = tau(square root of the largest square
dividing n)</i>. Note that the square root of the largest square
dividing <i>n</i>, which we write as <i>s(n)</i>, is integer sequence
[<a href="http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi/?Anum=000188">A000188</a>].
</p><p align="justify">
<b> Proof of Lemma 1.</b>
<br>
Writing
<i>n=p<sub>1</sub><sup>k<sub>1</sub></sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>k<sub>m</sub></sup></i>,
the largest square dividing <i>n</i> is
<i>p<sub>1</sub><sup>2[k<sub>1</sub>/2]</sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>2[k<sub>m</sub>/2]</sup></i>,
the square root of which is:
<i>p<sub>1</sub><sup>[k<sub>1</sub>/2]</sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>[k<sub>m</sub>/2]</sup></i>,
where <i>[z]</i> denotes the integer part of fraction <i>z</i>. The
pairs of integers dividing <i>n</i> are of the form:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>(a,b) =
(p<sub>1</sub><sup>x<sub>1</sub></sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>x<sub>m</sub></sup>,
p<sub>1</sub><sup>k<sub>1</sub> -
x<sub>1</sub></sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>k<sub>m</sub> - x<sub>m</sub></sup>)</i>
</center>
<p align="justify">and <i>a|b</i> if for all <i>i, x<sub>i</sub> =&lt; k<sub>i</sub> -
x<sub>i</sub></i>, ie. <i>x<sub>i</sub> =&lt; k<sub>i</sub>/2</i>. Therefore,
each <i>x<sub>i</sub></i> can be <i>0,1,2,...,[k<sub>i</sub>/2]</i>,
and:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<i>f(n) = ([k<sub>1</sub>/2] + 1)([k<sub>2</sub>/2] +
1)...([k<sub>m</sub>/2] + 1) =
tau(p<sub>1</sub><sup>[k<sub>1</sub>/2]</sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>[k<sub>1</sub>/2]</sup>)
= tau(s(n)),</i>

</p><p align="justify">
<b>Proof of Theorem 1.</b>
<br>
Suppose that <i>a</i> sets a record for <i>f</i>. Therefore, <i>f(a) &gt;
f(1), f(a) &gt; f(2), ..., f(a) &gt; f(a-1)</i>, and by lemma 1, this means
that <i>tau(s(a)) &gt; tau(s(1)), tau(s(a)) &gt; tau(s(2)), ..., tau(s(a)) &gt;
tau(s(a-1))</i>. Suppose now that <i>c<sup>2</sup></i> is the largest
square less than or equal to <i>a</i>. Then we see that: </p><p></p><center>
<i>tau(s(a)) &gt; tau(s(1)) = tau(1) <br>tau(s(a)) &gt; tau(s(4)) = tau(2)
<br> . &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br>tau(s(a)) &gt; tau(s((c-1)<sup>2</sup>)) =
tau(c-1) </i></center><p align="justify">If <i>a &gt; c<sup>2</sup></i>,
the largest square dividing <i>a</i> will be less than
<i>c<sup>2</sup></i> and <i>s(a) &lt; c</i>. But then, <i>s(a) = c -
k</i> for some <i>k</i>, and <i>tau(s(a)) = tau(c-k)</i>, which is a
contradiction. Hence <i>a = c<sup>2</sup>, s(a) = c,</i> and <i>tau(c)
&gt; tau(c - i)</i> for all <i>i &lt; c</i>, which makes <i>c</i> a highly
composite number, and <i>a</i> the square of a highly composite
number.
</p><p align="justify">
Suppose now that <i>b</i> is a highly composite number, and
<i>a=b<sup>2</sup></i>. Therefore, <i>s(a) = b</i>, and, as <i>b</i>
is highly composite, if, for some <i>k, tau(s(a-k)) &gt;
tau(s(a))</i>, then <i>s(a-k) &gt; s(a) = b,</i> which is
impossible. Hence, for all <i>k &lt; a, tau(s(a)) &gt; tau(s(a - k))</i>, and by
lemma 1, <i>f(a) &gt; f(a - k)</i>, thus <i>a</i> sets a
record for <i>f</i>. <font color="red">QED</font>
</p><p align="justify">
Coincidentally, the previous time there was a similar confusion over a
machine invented concept, Douglas Lenat, who wrote the AM program, <a href="#lenat">[3]</a>, thought for a while that what he called
maximally divisible numbers were a machine invention. These turned out
to be the highly composite numbers we've discussed here, which were
originally developed by Ramanujan, <a href="#ramanujan">[4]</a>.
</p><p align="justify">
This time, we will only claim that it is possible that the function
<i>f</i> above was invented by HR, and that it is possible that, while
the concept of the squares of highly composite numbers may have been
looked at before, HR may have been the first to define them as setting
the record for <i>f</i>. It was fortunate that tau numbers had not
been added to the encyclopedia, because we may have decided not to
develop them. However, the story of refactorable/tau numbers
emphasises the need for databases of mathematical knowledge such as
the encyclopedia of integer sequences, <a href="#sloane">[5]</a>,
which can be used by people and computers alike to check the novelty
of inventions.
