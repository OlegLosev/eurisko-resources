A career goal for me would be to see discovery programs used by
mathematicians as much as computer algebra packages. There is a long
way to go.

</p><h2>Planned Work</h2>

<p align="justify">
Most of the present HR project is now finished, as I'm writing up my
PhD thesis. There is one exception:

</p><p align="justify">

Graham Steel's MSc. project will be on the topic of "cross domain
concept formation". This will build on the theory behind the HR
program, and enhance that theory with an understanding of how to make
concepts which involve aspects from more than one domain. Such
cross-domain concepts include:
</p><ul>
<li>Number theory concepts found outside of number theory. These are
ubiquitous, for example, in group theory, prime numbers are needed to
develop the theory of Sylow subgroups, in graph theory, numerical
invariants are mainstream concepts.</li>
<li>Sub-algebras of a different nature than the parent algebra. For
example, in group theory, one can of course look for subgroups, but it 
is also common to look for sub-semigroups.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
Possible ways to approach this project are to enable HR to transfer
concepts from one session in one domain (probably number theory), to a 
new session in another domain. Also, HR can already look for subgroups 
in group theory, so it shouldn't be too difficult for it to look for
sub-semigroups, etc. in group theory.

</p><h2>Possible Extensions</h2>

<p align="justify">
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics13_files/bullet.html" valign="center" align="top" height="10" width="10" border="0"> Running multiple copies of HR in parallel, with each
communicating the most interesting concepts and conjectures it has
found. This would enable more extensive searches and a greater
diversity of concepts to be found.

<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics13_files/bullet.html" valign="center" align="top" height="10" width="10" border="0"> More production rules. HR can reach many interesting
concepts, but there are certain concepts which it cannot reach yet,
for example, the concept of normal subgroups. More production rules
are needed to enable HR to further explore a theory.
</p><p align="justify">

Application to more domains. Any domain where there is a top level
object (eg. group, ring, integer), which can be broken down into
sub-objects (eg. elements, divisors, digits), can be looked at by
HR. In particular, we would like to try HR in plane geometry, where
every situation (diagram) can be decomposed into finite sets of
points, lines, circles, etc., with relations such as being parallel, a 
point being on a line and so on.

generators. To give HR more chance of settling conjectures and
concepts, it should be able to look at the problem in hand, and choose
between a number of theorem provers and model generators. In
particular, if HR had access to an inductive theorem prover, it could
prove conjectures in number theory.

<br>
Whereas an engineer might use a computer algebra (CA) package because
the actual calculation is very important, research mathematicians
might use a CA package to explore and understand a function or other
concept type. One way to explore a function is to calculate some
values output for suitable inputs, and this is where CA packages come
in. However, the exploration doesn't need to stop there, and, if a
discovery module was added to a CA package, the program could tell the
user much more about the function than just some calculations. For
example, it could make conjectures about the range of the function,
for example that the output of the function was always a square
number. It could also make conjectures by restricting the range of a
function, for example making the conjecture that the function
restricted to prime numbers was always zero. Using concept formation
techniques, more complicated statements could be made. For example,
a composition of the function with another functions could be
introduced and analysed.

</p><p align="justify">
There are many ways in which a function or predicate could be explored
while within a computer algebra system. Such a system would require:

</p><ul>
<li> A concept formation module </li>
<li> A conjecture making module </li>
<li> A database of concepts (such as the encyclopedia of integer
sequences)</li>
<li> A theorem proving module </li>
</ul>
