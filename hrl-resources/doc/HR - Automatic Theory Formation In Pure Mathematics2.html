This is the number of integers less than <i>n</i> but with the same
number of divisors as <i>n</i>. HR found this sequence using its new
"common" production rule.

<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics2_files/bullet.html" valign="center" align="top" height="10" width="10" border="0"> HR has been reported in the spring 1999 issue of "New
Electronics", in an article on machine creativity by David Boothroyd:

</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">
...But two years ago, a program written at the Argonne National
Laboratory in Illinois achieved a mathematical proof that had beaten
some of the finest mathematicians for decades. Called the Robbins
Conjecture, it was suggested by Herbert Robbins in the 1930s. It
relates to a set of three equations and the task was to prove that
they were equivalent to a Boolean Algebra. It has been hailed as one
of the true breakthroughs in automated theorem proving.
</p><p align="justify">
"It was a major event in automated mathematics," says Simon Colton, a
mathematical researcher at Edinburgh University's School of Artificial 
Intelligence. "This was a 65 year old conjecture that was finally
proved by a computer theorem prover."
</p><p align="justify">
Colton himself works in this area, having developed a program called
HR that invents definitions in pure mathematics. For example, the
following sequence was produced when HR was looking at number theory:
1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 40, 56, 60, 72, 80, 84, 88, 96 ,... These 
are `refactorable 
numbers', where the number of divisors is itself a divisor. An example 
is 9, which has 3 divisors, (1,3 and 9), and 3 divides 9.
</p><p align="justify">
"It appears that such numbers have been overlooked by mathematicians
and we've proved some nice results about them", Colton says. "For
example, all odd refactorable numbers are square numbers. HR now not
only invents definitions, but also makes conjectures about them and
either proves the conjecture, or finds a counterexample. It is
particularly effective in algebraic domains, such as group theory and
ring theory."
</p><p align="justify">
HR works in pure mathematics, so practical applications are hardly
likely to be immediate, but then that is true of human work in this
field.
</p><p align="justify">
Another significant mathematical program is Graffiti, which produces
conjectures in what is known as graph theory. Some of these have been
proved or disproved by some of the world's greatest mathematicians,
such as the late Paul Erdos.
</p><p align="justify">
It is perhaps not surprising that creative computing would appear
first in mathematics. Mathematics is, in many ways, a self contained
world where the expertise required is highly specific and constrained
in nature....

A New Scientist article has discussed HR (5th September 1998, page
17): 
</p><blockquote>
<p align="justify">
... The Brighton conference also heard that the University of
Edinburgh has used a similar program, called HR, to make mathematical
findings. Last month, HR "discovered" a new sequence of integers,
called refactorables. The sequence has been accepted into the
Encyclopedia of Online Sequences, the main global repository for such
information, the researchers say.
</p><p align="justify">
Toby Walsh, a member of the Edinburgh team, says HR's intelligence
comprises a set of heuristics, or human rules of thumb. "The
heuristics are sufficiently strong that we don't need to do too much
brute-force searching", he says. Both Muggleton and Walsh are quick to
point out that scientists should not hang up their lab coats. "What
we're doing will help mathematicians understand how they do
mathematics, so they may be able to do it better", says Walsh ...
