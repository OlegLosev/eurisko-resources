<p align="justify">
There are many ways to break an integer into a finite set. HR can work
in number theory by using a finite decomposition of integers into one
or more of the following:
</p><ol>
<li> Triples <i>(a,b,c)</i> for which <i>a=bxc</i>. Eg. (10,5,2)</li>
<li> Triples <i>(a,b,c)</i> for which <i>a=b+c</i>. Eg. (10,4,6)</li>
<li> Pairs <i>(a,b)</i> for which <i>b</i> is a digit in the base 10
representation of <i>a</i>. Eg. (12,1), (12,2)</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
In practice, the decomposition of the integers up to 50 are given to
HR by the user. HR then uses exactly the same production rules that were developed in
group theory to produce number theory concepts.
</p><p>
<a name="encyclopedia">
</a></p><h2><a name="encyclopedia">The Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a></h2><a name="encyclopedia">
<p>
HR works closely with its own copy of the encyclopedia of integer
sequences, the home page for which is here:
</p></a><p align="center"><a name="encyclopedia">
</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010722203152/http://www.research.att.com/%7Enjas/sequences/eisonline.html">
Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>
</p>
<p align="justify">
The encyclopedia contains over 47,000 integer sequences, all of which
detail a different number theory concept. Each sequence has a unique
"A-number", for example the sequence of prime numbers has number
A000040. HR can turn its number theory concepts into integer sequences
by either:
</p><ol>
<li>Writing down the integers of a particular type,
eg. 2,3,5,7,11,... (primes)</li>
<li>Taking the integers 1,2,3, etc. and writing out the output of a
function for them, eg. 1,2,2,3,2,... (tau function: the number of
divisors).</li>
<li>Writing down the integers which output a larger number than all
smaller numbers for a particular function, eg. 1,2,4,6,12,... (highly
composite numbers: they have more divisors than any smaller positive
integer). [This will become a mainstream production rule in the near
future]. </li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
When prompted to do so, HR can generate sequences from its concepts
and check whether they match any in the encyclopedia. It does this by
first using the empirical evidence it has for the integers in its
database, to suggest possible candidate sequences from the
encyclopedia and then it uses the prolog representation of the concept
to check membership of each encyclopedia entry. For example, if
working with the integers up to 20, if HR's 17th concept was actually
prime numbers, it would take each sequence in turn and check that
2,3,5,...,19 were in the sequence, but 1,4,6,...,20 were not. If a
sequence passed this test, HR would check that
<t>predicate(17,[a<sub>1</sub>]), predicate(17,[a<sub>2</sub>]), </t>
etc. returned true for all the integers <t>a<sub>i</sub></t> stored in
the encyclopedia for that sequence. It would of course spot that
sequence A000040 passed both tests for predicate 17.

More interesting than the fact that HR reinvented these sequences are
the ways in which HR defines them. For example, even numbers
are defined as integers, <i>n</i> for which there is a natural number,
<i>m</i>, such that <i>m+m=n</i>. Also, the natural numbers in base 3
were defined as integers in base 10 which have no digits which can be
written as <i>a+b</i> where <i>a&gt;0</i>, <i>b&gt;0</i> and <i>a=/=
b</i>. Also, it defines the powers of two as those integers with no
odd divisors except 1.

<p align="justify">
In May 1998, in literally its first session in number theory, HR
outputted this sequence of integers:
</p><p>
</p><center>
1,2,8,9,12,18,24,36,40,56,60,72,80,84,88,96, ..
</center>
</a><p align="justify"><a name="refactorables">
These have the appealing definition of being those integers for which
the number of divisors is itself a divisor. We were surprised to see
that no sequence, or similar sequence was present in the
encyclopedia, and so we gave them a name, `refactorables', and
submitted them to the encyclopedia. They were accepted and given
A-number  [</a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010722203152/http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi/?Anum=A033950" target="_top">A033950</a>].
</p><p align="justify">
After submitting them to the encyclopedia, we looked through the
mathematical literature to find discussion of them, but we could find
no reference. Therefore, we claimed them as a machine invention, and
discussed them in talks about HR. After discussing HR at the ECAI'98
machine discovery workshop, a reporter for the New Scientist magazine
wrote a couple of paragraphs about HR's achievements: (5th September,
page 17),
Further, we began to develop refactorable numbers, and found that
they have many interesting properties, for example, that all odd
refactorables are prime, perfect numbers are not refactorable,
etc. All these results were presented in a paper published in the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010722203152/http://www.research.att.com/%7Enjas/sequences/JIS/">Journal of Integer sequences</a>(JIS):

Refactorable Numbers - A Machine Invention</a>
</center>
<p align="justify">
Some of the results in the above paper were conjectured by HR, and we
thought that publication of the paper would be the final chapter in
the story of refactorables. However, two mathematicians, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010722203152/http://www.math-cs.cmsu.edu/%7Erkennedy/rkennedy.html">Robert
Kennedy</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010722203152/http://www.math-cs.cmsu.edu/%7Erkennedy/ccooper.html">Curtis
Cooper</a>, from the Central Missouri State University, read the above
paper and emailed in March 1999 to say that the concept of
refactorables had been defined already, and that they were actually
called "tau numbers". In fact they had written a paper in 1990 which
discussed tau numbers, which is available from Robert Kennedy's web
page:

Tau Numbers, Natural Density, and Hardy and Wright's Theorem 437
</a>
</center>
<p align="justify">
The fact that HR only re-invented tau numbers shouldn't detract from
its achievement, as these integers are clearly interesting and despite
having a very simple definition, they have only recently been
introduced to number theory, and have rarely been discussed.
I've written a addenda to the JIS paper, which discusses the
implications of the news. The addenda can be read here:

<h2>The CRCM (Datamining with the Encyclopedia)</h2>

<p align="justify">
A sub-project of the HR project is called the CRCM program, which
stands for "concept-rich conjecture making". This is designed not to
find conjectures as a theory is being constructed, but rather to find
conjectures when there are many concepts already invented. The example 
we use here is the encyclopedia of integer sequences, which contains
over 45,000 different number theory concepts. The CRCM is charged with 
the task of making conjectures about the integer sequences. One way to 
do this is to look for sequences which are subsequences of a given
sequences. For example, when running the CRCM, we could ask for
subsequences of the prime numbers:
</p><p>
</p><pre>?- subsequences_of('A000040').

Looking for subsequences of: A000040 The prime numbers.

A000040 The prime numbers.

A046496 Primes expressible as the sum of 4 consecutive palindromes.

3600 matches found.
yes

</pre>
<p align="justify">
3600 matches is clearly too many. To reduce the number of sequences
output, we need to understand how HR suggests subsequences.
<br>
<br><b>Definition 10.1:</b>
An integer, <i>n</i>, is a <i>member</i> of sequence, <i>s</i>, if it
appears in the encyclopedia entry for that sequence. Note that,
although 10007 is a prime number, it does not appear in the
encyclopedia for sequence 'A000040' (prime numbers), hence it is not a
member of the sequence for our purposes.

<br><br><b>Definition 10.2:</b>
The <i>range</i> of an integer sequence is the set of integers between
the smallest and largest entries in the encyclopedia for the
sequence. For example, the encyclopedia entry for prime numbers is:
2,3,5,...,271, so the range of this sequence is the set
{2,3,4,5,...,271}.
<br><br>
</p><hr>
Sequence <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> is then suggested as a possible
subsequence of sequence <i>s<sub>2</sub></i> if there is no member of
<i>s<sub>1</sub></i> which is not a member of
<i>s<sub>2</sub></i>.
<hr>
<p align="justify">
Note that this way of suggesting subsequences
will suggest any sequence whose range is disjoint with the one in
question, and often these suggestions should be avoided. This prompted
the following definition:

<br><br><b>Definition 10.3:</b> The <i>term overlap</i> of sequence
<i>s<sub>1</sub></i> and sequence <i>s<sub>2</sub></i> is the number
of integers which are members of both <i>s<sub>1</sub></i> and
<i>s<sub>2</sub></i>. Note that this is <u>not</u> counted multiplicatively.

<br><br> If we set a term overlap minimum of, say, 5 integers, then
this reduces the number of suggestions produced by HR from 3600 to
1129, which is an improvement. We can also impose the requirement that
the suggested sequence be increasing. This will identify subsequences
that are possibly integer types. This reduces the number of HR's
suggestions from 1129 to 1018, which is again an improvement. Finally,
we can use keywords provided by the encyclopedia about the type of
sequence HR suggests. Certain sequences have keywords associated, such
as "nice" or "core" or "base" (involving integers written in a base
other than 10). If we impose the condition that HR's suggestions have
to be categorised as "nice", then we narrow down the output to just
15:
</p><p>
</p><pre>?- set(term_overlap_min,5), set(increasing,yes), set(keyword,nice).

yes

There are other conjectures we can ask HR to make using the
encyclopedia. For example, we can ask for supersequences to a given
sequence. Also, we can ask for sequences where the nth term is always
less than (or greater than) the term in the sequence we are interested
in. Also, HR can compose two functions, and spot when the composition
always gives a constant (eg. tau(prime_number) = 2). Finally, HR can
point out which sequences are completely disjoint to a particular
sequence.
</p><p align="justify">
To keep the number of suggestions output by HR for these conjecture
types down to a minimum, there are many other measures HR can use,
including:
<br><br>
</p><li><font color="red">Density</font> of the suggested sequence.</li><br>
This is: <i>(number of distinct terms)/(number of terms)</i>.<p>
</p><li><font color="red">Range overlap</font> of two sequences.</li><br>
This is the proportion of terms from the second sequence that are
in the range of the first sequence.<p>
</p><li><font color="red">Range size</font> of the suggested
sequence.</li><br>
This is the difference between the smallest and largest terms in the
sequence.<p>
</p><li><font color="red">Difference</font> of two sequences.</li>This is
the average of |<i>a(n) - b(n)</i>| where <i>a(n)</i> is the
<i>n</i>th term of the first sequence, and <i>a(n)</i> is the
<i>n</i>th term of the second sequence.<p>
</p><li><font color="red">Variety</font> of the suggested sequence.</li><br>
This is the number of distinct terms in the sequence.

<p align="justify">
None of the results above about prime numbers are particularly
interesting, but HR has suggested some conjectures which were unknown
to us and were subsequently proved. These four were presented and
proved in the JIS paper about refactorables:
</p><ol>
<li>A033950 is a subsequence of A047466</li>
<br>
<font color="green">In English:</font> Tau numbers are congruent to
0,1,2 or 4 mod 8. This was fairly easy to prove.
<li>A033950 is a subsequence of A009230</li>
<br>
<font color="green">In English:</font> Tau numbers can be written as
<i>lcm(n,tau(n))</i> for some <i>n</i>. This was obvious from the
definition of tau numbers.
<li>A000396 is a subsequence of A009242.</li>
<br>
<font color="green">In English:</font> Even perfect numbers can be written as
<i>lcm(n,sigma(n))</i> for some <i>n</i>. [Where <i>sigma(n)</i> is
the sum of the divisors of <i>n</i>. This took a little more
proving.
<li>A000396 is a subsequence of A007517.</li>
<br>
<font color="green">In English:</font> Even perfect numbers can be
written as <i>lcm(n,phi(n))</i>. [Where <i>phi(n)</i> is the number of

</ol>
Here are some more recent results, some of which have not been settled
yet.
<ol>
<li>A002301 is a subsequence of A033950</li>
<br>
<font color="green">In English:</font> Numbers of the form <i>(n!)/3</i>

is true up to 100!, but we have not proved or disproved it yet.
