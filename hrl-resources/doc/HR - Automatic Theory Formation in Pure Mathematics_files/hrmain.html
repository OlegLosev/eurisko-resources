</p><h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p align="justify">
HR is a system designed to invent and assess mathematical
definitions. Imagine sitting down with a pen and paper and writing
down the factorisation of the integers:
</p><p>
1 = 1 x 1<br>
2 = 1 x 2 = 2 x 1<br>
3 = 1 x 3 = 3 x 1<br>
4 = 1 x 4 = 2 x 2 = 4 x 1<br>
etc.,
</p><p align="justify">
Then, after trying out some ideas and making some calculations,
imagine selecting these numbers for special attention:
</p><p>
</p><center>
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...
</center>
<p align="justify">
In this case, you've re-invented the concept of square numbers. You
could equally have singled out the prime numbers:
</p><p>
</p><center>
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...
</center>
<p align="justify">
This is what HR does. Further, HR provides reasons why certain
concepts are interesting, either by showing how novel the concept is,
or how good it is at classification, or by proving theorems about it.
HR then uses the most interesting concepts to build new concepts from,
and creates a theory which includes:
</p><ul>
<li> Definitions of concepts </li>
<li> Calculations </li>
<li> Models (eg. groups)</li>
<li> Theorems and proofs</li>
<li> Open conjectures</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
This theory is then written up using the standard mathematical
typesetting language, LaTeX, and presented to the user. HR also
provides other ways in which the user can investigate HR's findings,
such as a set of graphs showing how each concept was produced.

</p><p align="justify">
HR has been developed mainly in the domain of group theory. However,
HR can work in many different domains of pure mathematics, including
any finite algebra (quasigroup theory, ring theory, loop theory, etc),
number theory and graph theory.
</p><p align="justify">
This note gives an overview of how HR <a href="#build_concepts">builds</a> and <a href="#assess_concepts">
assesses</a> concepts, how it <a href="#make_conjectures">makes</a>
and <a href="#assess_conjectures">assesses</a> conjectures about the
concepts and how it uses third party theorem prover Otter and model
generator MACE to <a href="#settle_conjectures">settle</a> the
conjectures. After some indication of how HR forms <a href="#theory">theories</a> in pure mathematics, and a brief guide to <a href="#using_hr">using</a> the program, an assessment of HR in <a href="#group_theory">group theory</a>, <a href="#number_theory">number
theory</a> and <a href="#graph_theory">graph theory</a> is
given. Finally, I look at some possible ways in which HR could be
developed in the <a href="#future">future</a>, provide some links to
<a href="#papers">papers</a> which contain more detail about HR, and
provide some <a href="#links">links</a> to machine discovery in
science.

</p><p align="justify">
This web-page is designed both to provide an informal overview of what
HR does, and to provide a repository where I can store interesting
results, statistics, facts, etc. Therefore, while the information here is
fairly non-technical, there is a lot of it!
