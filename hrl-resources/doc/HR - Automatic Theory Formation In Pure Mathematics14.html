HR invented a new type of integer, called the refactorable numbers.
A note developing refactorables, along with an overview of how
HR invented them appears in the Journal of Integer Sequences (article 99.1.2).

We were notified that refactorables were already defined in 1990,
which prompted this addenda to the above paper:
