This is under construction, please bear with me.
</p><p align="justify">
At present, HR works only with connected graphs, but there is no
reason why it shouldn't work with graphs in general. HR uses three
tables to represent connected graphs, one for the nodes, one for the
edges and one for the relation: node a is on edge e. For example,
these graphs:

<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics12_files/graphs.html">
</p><p>
are represented by these tables:

<a name="graph_diagrams"></a>
</p><p align="justify">
This representation allows HR to re-invent many graph theory concepts, 
including types of graph and numerical invariants, as discussed
below. HR works with the connected graphs with four or less nodes, but 
can access the connected graphs with up to six nodes for disproving
conjectures, etc. 

</p><h2>Diagrams of Graphs</h2>

<p align="justify">
To help us understand the concepts HR introduces in graph theory, HR
can invoke the DOT program from AT&amp;T. The graphs produced are not
particularly eye-catching (it would be better to use the neato
program, but I can't get this to work at the moment), but they serve
the purpose. HR can identify graphs of a given type: eg, in a recent
session, HR's 31st concept was a type of graph known as a star (for
obvious reasons). When asked to view this concept, we see that HR puts
those graphs in boxes and we get the following:
</p><pre><font color="green">
?- view::gt_concept(31).
</font>
</pre>
<center>
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics12_files/stars.html">
</center>
<p align="justify">
Also, HR can identify nodes, or edges of a particular type,
eg. concept 12 was the centre node of stars, and when asked to show
this concept, HR puts square boxes around the nodes in question:
</p><pre><font color="green">
?- view::gt_concept(12).
</font>
</pre>
<center>
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics12_files/centres_of_stars.html">
</center>
<p align="justify">
Also, HR can display all the graphs of a given type from its store for
counterexample finding. For example, concept 86 was the re-invented
concept of complete graphs (ie. every pair of nodes joined by an
edge). Asked to display all these, we see:
</p><pre><font color="green">
?- view::all_graphs_of_type(86).
</font>
</pre>
<center>
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics12_files/complete_graphs.html">
