<h2>5. HOW HR MAKES CONJECTURES</h2>

<p align="justify">
In order to be able to better assess the concepts HR has invented, it
can make some conjectures about them, based on the empirical evidence
supplied by the models. As the data-tables are complete, the
conjectures are true for all the entities in the theory.

<a name="subsumption"></a>
</p><h2>Subsumption Conjectures</h2>

<p align="justify">
If HR produces a new data-table, it is asked to find previous concepts
where either the old data-table contains the new data-table, or the
old data-table is contained in the new data-table. For example,
suppose HR produced this data-table:
</p><p align="center">
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics5_files/even_squares.html">
</p>
<p align="justify">
with definition [N] : 2|N &amp; exists a (a*a=N), ie. even square
numbers. Also suppose that HR had previously produced this data-table:
</p><p align="center">
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics5_files/multiples_of_four.html">
</p>
<p align="justify">
with definition: [N] : 4|N, ie. multiples of 4. Then HR would spot
that all the rows of its new data-table were rows of the previous data
table, and could make the conjecture:
</p><p>
</p><center>
2|N &amp; exists a (a*a=N) -&gt; 4|N.
</center>
<p align="justify">
ie. HR can make the conjecture that all even square numbers are
multiples of 4. Other subsumption conjectures include, in group
theory, that the centre of a group contains the identity
element. Because of the nature of the concept formation, lots of
concepts are specialisations of previous ones, so there are many
subsumption conjectures that HR comes across. To cut down on the
number of trivially true subsumption conjectures, HR first estimates
the surprisingness of the conjecture, (see <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010722202636fw_/http://www.dai.ed.ac.uk/homes/simonco/research/hr/assess_conjecture">Section 6</a> below), and discards any where
the conjecture is likely to be unsurprising.

<a name="equivalence"></a>
</p><h2>Equivalence Conjectures</h2>

<p align="justify">
In the same way that HR can spot when one data-table is contained in
another, it can also spot that two data-tables are exactly the
same. In this case, it can make the conjecture that the definitions
for the two concepts are equivalent. For example, suppose HR produced
the following data table:
</p><p align="center">
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics5_files/powers_of_two.html">
</p>
<p align="justify">
and did so using the fold production rule, giving them a definition
"powers of two" (or something similar). Then also suppose that HR
produces another data-table later which is exactly the same, but this
time had the definition: "integers with no odd divisors except 1",
then HR could make the conjecture that an integer has no odd divisors
except 1 if and only if it is a power of two. This example is
contrived, but some better examples occur in group theory. For
example, HR makes conjectures like this in group theory:
</p><p>
</p><center>for all a,b,c, a*b=c &amp; a*c=b &amp; b=id &lt;-&gt; a*b=c &amp; c*a=b &amp; a*a=b</center>
<p>
which is neither trivial nor obvious.


<a name="applicability"></a>
</p><h2>Applicability Conjectures</h2>

Imagine stating Goldbach's conjecture as an equivalence
conjecture. One way to do this would be to say that
<p>
</p><center> <i>n</i> is an even number greater than 4 &lt;-&gt; <i>n</i> is the
sum of two odd primes
</center>
<p align="justify">
To do so automatically, HR would have to invent the concept of even
numbers greater than 4, which is unlikely, as it is so specialised. If
we gave HR the concept of numbers greater than 4, we would stand a
better chance of HR spotting this conjecture, but that would be
cheating. A much more natural way for HR to spot this conjecture is
to:
</p><ol>
<li>invent the concept of even numbers which are the sum of two odd
primes.</li>
<li>from this, build the concept of even numbers which are <u>not</u>
the sum
of two odd primes.</li>
<li>spot that the data-table for this concept has very few rows (in
fact, only 2).</li>
<li>make the conjecture that the only even integers which are not the
sum of two odd primes are 2 and 4.</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
This is an example of an applicability conjecture, where HR spots that
the number of entities (integers, groups, graphs, etc.) satisfying a
concept's conditions is small, and makes the conjecture that the only
entities whatsoever which satisfy the conditions are those it has in
its table.

</p><p align="justify">
Two nice examples of applicability conjectures that HR makes are:
</p><ul>
<li> The only integers for which <i>tau(n)=sqrt(n)</i> are 1 and
9</li>
<li> The only integers for which <i>tau(n)=n</i> are 1 and 2</li>
</ul>
[where <i>tau(n)</i>=number of divisors of <i>n</i>].
<p align="justify">
If a production rule step produces a data-table with no rows
whatsoever, HR can make a non-existence conjecture which states that
there are no models whatsoever which satisfy the definition of the
concept. For example, if HR attempted to use the conjunct production
rule with tables 2 and 4 above, it would produce an empty table. In
this case, it would make the conjecture that there are no integers
which are both prime and square.
