HR deals with three aspects of a mathematical concept:
</p><ul><li>Models: ie. examples of a concept, for instance, the
models of prime numbers are 2,3,5,7,11, etc.</li>
<li>Definitions. A concept may have more than one
definition. For example, primes are often (incorrectly) defined as
those integers divisible by only 1 and themselves - which means that 1
is a prime number. A better definition is: those integers with exactly
2 divisors.</li>
<li>Properties of concepts. These are measurable qualities of a
concept which give more information than the definition and models
alone. For example a property of prime numbers is that there are 25
primes less than 100.</li>
</ul>
<a name="representation"></a>
<h2>Representation</h2>
<p align="justify">
In HR, two things are used to represent the concept, the models and
the construction history (a series of instructions detailing how the
concept was built using previous concepts). HR is not tied to a single
logical formalism for the definitions of the concepts it
produces. Definitions are generated as and when they are needed, using
the construction history, and are given in whichever format is
required for the task at hand. For example, when the definition is
required in a proof by the Otter theorem prover (see later), it is
generated in a first order logic style acceptable to Otter. Similarly,
when the user wants to read the definition, it is output in LaTeX and
marked up to make it more readable. This approach makes it easier for
HR to interact with theorem provers, model generators, computer
algebra packages and so on.

</p><p align="justify"> The models in HR are stored as complete
data-tables. By complete, we mean that there is no missing data. An
initial set of concepts (which can be given by the user, or generated
by HR and MACE, if the user supplies the axioms of the finite algebra
of interest), are given to HR in the form of data-tables. HR needs to
know how to de-compose each entity into elements and it needs some
relations between the elements. For example, amongst others, integers
can be broken into finite sets of:

</p><ol>
<li>Divisors</li>
<li>Digits</li>
<li>Positive integers less than them</li>
</ol>
<p align="justify">
and these would be stored as the following tables:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics3_files/integer_representations.html">
</center>
<p align="justify">
Then the multiplication relation can be given for pairs of divisors of
an integer, and the addition relation can be given for pairs of
integers less than the integer. The tables for these concepts are:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics3_files/integer_relations.html">
</center>
<p align="justify">
Note that presenting addition and multiplication in this way ensures
that the tables are complete.
</p><p align="justify">
When working in a finite algebra, both the decompositions and
relations are determined by the axioms. In the following table, I give 
some algebras and their decompositions and relations.
</p><p>
<table align="center" width="75%" border="3">
<tbody><tr>
<td><font color="red">Algebra</font></td>
<td><font color="red">Decompositions</font></td>
<td><font color="red">Relations</font></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Group</td>
<td>Elements, Identities</td>
<td>Multiplication (*), Inverses</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Ring</td>
<td>Elements, Additive Identities</td>
<td>Addition, Multiplication, Additive Inverse</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>IP-loop</td>
<td>Elements, Identities</td>
<td>Multiplication, IP</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p align="justify">
When working in graph theory, the decomposition is into nodes, and the 
relation is given by the edges. We are currently implementing ways by
which HR can use more complicated decompositions, for example graphs
into paths of nodes.

<a name="build_examples"></a>
</p><h2>Example Constructions</h2>

<p align="justify">
HR builds new concepts using one of a set of production rules which
take data-tables of old concepts and output new data-tables. For
example, below we are given Table 0, with the division of integers up
to 4, namely rows [<i>a,b,c</i>] where <i>a=b*c</i>. The "match"
production rule then takes table 0 and produces table 1 by finding all
rows in table 0 where the 2nd and 3rd columns are the same.

</p><p>
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics3_files/squares.html">
</p><p align="justify">
Each production rule is supplied with parameters to describe exactly
what to do. In this case, the parameters [1,2,2] should be read: "find
rows where column 1 is the same as column 1, column 2 is the same as
column 2 and column 3 is the same as column 2". As column 2 and 3 are
the same, the new data-table has only one column here. After the match
production rule has produced table 1, the new table is input to the
"exists" production rule. The exists production rule simply removes
columns from the input table, and the parameters tell it which
column(s) to keep. In this case, the parameters [1] tell it to keep
just the first column. The outcome of these two production rules is to
take the given table of divisions of the integers and to re-invent the
square numbers.
</p><p align="justify">
In the second example, below, we see the size and split production
rules in action. The size production rule counts the number of times
an entry is seen in a column. For example, if we look down column one
of Table 0 below, we see that the number 1 appears once, 2 and 3
appear twice and the number 4 appears three times. The parameters [1]
for the size production rule tell it to count the number of
occurrences of entries in column 1. The split production rule, with
parameters 2=2, goes through table 1 and finds rows where column two
equals the numerical value 2. The outcome of these two production
rules is to take the given table of divisions of the integers and to
re-invent the prime numbers.

<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics3_files/primes.html">
</p><p align="justify">
Note that the construction history of the tables is recorded as a set
of triples (old_concept, production_rule, parameters), which have to be
performed to reconstruct the data-table. For example, the construction
history for table 4 above is:
</p><p>
</p><center>
(0,size,[1])<br>
(3,split,[2=2])<br>
</center>

<p align="justify">
HR is also given a definition for table 0, which we write in the form:
</p><p align="center">
<font color="red">0. [a,b,c] : a=b*c.</font>
</p><p align="justify">
From this definition, and because it knows that the match production
rule was used to build table 1, it can generate a definition for the
pairs of integers in table 1 as this:
</p><p align="center">
<font color="red">1. [a,b] : a=b*b.</font>
</p><p align="justify">
From this definition, and because it knows that the exists production
rule was used to build table 2, it can generate a definition for the
integers in table 2 as this:
</p><p align="center">
<font color="red">2. [a] : exists b in <b>N</b> s.t. b*b=a.</font>
</p><p align="justify">
Similarly, HR can generate a definition for the pairs in table 3:
</p><p align="center">
<font color="red">3. [a,n] : n=|{(b,c) in <b>N</b><sup>2</sup> : b*c = a}|</font>
</p><p align="justify">
and from definition 3, a (slightly non-standard) definition for prime
numbers can be generated:
</p><p align="center">
<font color="red">4. [a] : 2=|{(b,c) in <b>N</b><sup>2</sup> : b*c =
a}</font></p><p align="justify">

<a name="production_rules"></a>
</p><h2> The Production Rules </h2>
<p align="justify">
There are at present 10 production rules, but these get added to from
time to time. Each production rule manipulates data-tables in a fairly
simple, and non-domain-specific way. An informal description of each
one is given here (in increasing difficulty).

</p><ol>
<li><font color="green">Exists</font> This removes columns.</li>
<li><font color="green">Match</font> This finds rows where certain
columns are identical.</li>
<li><font color="green">Size</font> This counts the number of occurrences
of each entry in a column.</li>
<li><font color="green">Split</font> This finds rows where certain
columns have certain (usually numerical) values.</li>
<li><font color="green">Negate</font> This produces the compliment of a
data-table, ie. those rows which could possibly be in the table, but
which aren't there.</li>
<li><font color="green">Conjunct</font> This takes two old data-tables
and finds rows in the first which match with rows in the second.</li>
<li><font color="green">Forall</font> This finds sets of rows where all
possible entries are present (eg. all the divisors of an
integer).</li>
<li><font color="green">Common</font> This finds entities (eg. integers)
in a data-table which have rows in common (eg. integers which share a
prime divisor).</li>
<li><font color="green">Compose</font> This takes two old data-tables
which can used to define functions, and computes the data-table
representing their composition.</li>
<li><font color="green">Fold</font> This constructs the orbit of
entities under a function (ie. it repeatedly takes the output of a
function and puts it back in as input).</li>
</ol>
