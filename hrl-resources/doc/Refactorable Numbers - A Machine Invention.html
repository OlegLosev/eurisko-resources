program invents and analyses definitions in areas of pure
mathematics, including finite algebras, graph theory and number

integer sequence, the refactorable numbers, which are defined
and developed here. A discussion of how HR works, along with details of

<u>1. Introduction</u>
</h2>

<p>
The following sequence of integers has recently been accepted into the
<a href="http://oeis.org/">OnLine
Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences</a>, <a href="#sloane">[9]</a>:
<br><br>
</p><center>
<hr>

<hr>
<br>
</center>
The sequence is interesting for two reasons:
<ul>
<li>
It has a simple definition: those integers <em>n</em> for which the number of
divisors of <em>n</em> divides <em>n</em>.
</li>
<li>
It was invented by a computer program.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
This note gives some results about the refactorables, followed by a
discussion of the 
<a href="http://dream.dai.ed.ac.uk/group/simonco/hr/">HR</a>
program which invented them and a look at some of
the other sequences HR has invented or reinvented.

<u>2. Refactorable Numbers</u>
</h2>

<p>
<strong>Notation.</strong>
Throughout, the number of divisors of an integer, <em>n</em>, is written
<em>τ</em>(<em>n</em>), the sum of the divisors of <em>n</em> is written <em>σ</em>(<em>n</em>)
and the number of integers less than and coprime to <em>n</em> is written <em>φ</em>(<em>n</em>).

</p><p>
<strong>Definition.</strong>
An integer, <em> n</em>, is a <strong>refactorable</strong> number if and only if <em>τ</em>(<em>n</em>)
divides <em>n</em>.

</p><p>
<strong>Lemma 1. (Theorem 273 from <a href="#hardy">[4]</a>)</strong>
If the prime factorization of <em> n</em> is
<br>
</p><center>
<em>n</em> =
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub><sup><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></sup> ... <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup><em>m</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></sup>
</center>
<br>
then <em>n</em> has (<em>m</em><sub>1</sub> + 1) ... (<em>m</em><sub>k</sub> + 1)
divisors.
<p>
<strong>Lemma 2.</strong>
An odd integer <em>k</em> is refactorable if and only if 2<em>k</em> is refactorable.
</p><p>
<strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose
<em>k</em> =
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub><sup><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></sup> ... <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup><em>m</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></sup>
&nbsp; By Lemma 1, if <em>k</em> is
refactorable, (<em>m</em><sub>1</sub> + 1) ... (<em>m</em><sub>k</sub> + 1) divides <em>k</em>.
Therefore the number of divisors of
<em>2k</em>, namely 2(<em>m</em><sub>1</sub> + 1)...(<em>m</em><sub>k</sub> + 1),
divides 2<em>k</em>, and so 2<em>k</em> is refactorable.
The converse follows by reversing the steps of the argument.
<font color="red">QED</font>.
<br>

</p><p>
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong> There are infinitely many odd refactorable numbers,
and infinitely many even refactorable numbers.
</p><p>
<strong>Proof.</strong> From Lemma 1, if <em>p</em> is a prime,
<em>q</em> = <em>p</em><sup><em>p</em> - 1</sup> has <em> p </em>
divisors, and so <em> q </em> is refactorable.  The result
now follows from Lemma 2.
<font color="red">QED</font>.

</p><p>
The set of integers of the form <em>p</em><sup><em>p</em> - 1</sup> forms a
subsequence of the refactorable numbers:
<br>
</p><center>
<hr>
[<a href="http://oeis.org/A036878">A036878</a>]:
2, 9, 625, 117649, 25937424601, 23298085122481, 48661191875666868481, ...
<hr>
</center>
<p>
A more interesting way to prove Theorem 1 is to take the integers
in numerical order, find their prime factorizations and 
apply the map:
</p><center>
<img src="Refactorable%20Numbers%20-%20A%20Machine%20Invention_files/img3.gif">
</center>
For example:
<center>
3 = 3<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; becomes &nbsp; 3<sup>3<sup>1</sup>-1</sup> = 9
</center>
and
<center>
6 = 2<sup>1</sup>3<sup>1</sup> &nbsp; becomes &nbsp; 2<sup>2<sup>1</sup>-1</sup>3<sup>3<sup>1</sup>-1</sup> = 18 
</center>
<p>
 It is easy to see that the integers produced from this map
must all be refactorable numbers, as they have
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub><sup><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></sup> ... <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup><em>m</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></sup>
divisors, and for any prime <em>p</em> and any integer <em>m</em> we have 
<em>m</em> &lt;= <em>p</em><sup>m</sup>-1, so the number of divisors divides the integer
itself.
The result of the transformation on a
even number is another even number, and the result on an odd number is
another odd number. It follows that there are infinitely many even and odd refactorable
numbers.
</p>
<p>
This mapping of the integers onto the refactorables produces 
another interesting sequence:
<br><br>
</p><hr>
<center>
[<a href="http://oeis.org/A036879">A036879</a>]:
1, 2, 9, 8, 625, 18, 117649, 128, 6561, 1250, 25937424601, 56, 23298085122481, 235298, ...
</center>
<hr>
<br>
This sequence does not of course include  all refactorable numbers: it is easy
to show that 12, for instance, does not belong to this sequence.
<a name="membership"></a>
<h3>2.1 Membership Theorems</h3>
<p>
Since primes have two divisors, 2 is the only
prime refactorable number.

</p><p>
<strong>Theorem 2.</strong> All odd refactorable numbers are squares.

</p><p>
<strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose <em>n</em> is as in Lemma 1, and is odd and refactorable.
Since each <em>m</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> + 1 must divide <em>n</em>,
each <em>m</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> is even, so <em>n</em> is a square.
<font color="red">QED</font>.

</p><p>
Theorem 2 makes it easy to search for odd refactorable numbers, which
form this subsequence:

</center>

<br>
The odd numbers which square to give these are:

</center>
<hr>
<br>
(It is easy to see that 3 is the only prime in this series.)

<p>
<strong>Theorem 3.</strong> No perfect number is refactorable.
</p><p>
<strong> Proof.</strong>
<br>
(a) <u>Even perfect numbers.</u> Using Theorem 277 from <a href="#hardy">[4]</a>, 
we know that if <em>k</em> is an even perfect number, it has the form
2<sup><em>n</em>-1</sup>(2<sup><em>n</em></sup>-1),
where 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>-1
is a prime, <em>p</em>, and using Theorem 18 from <a href="#hardy">[4]</a>,
we know that if 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>-1 is prime, then so is <em>n</em>.
Using Lemma 1, we know that <em>k</em> = 2<sup><em>n</em>-1</sup><em>p</em> must have
((<em>n</em>-1)+1)(1+1) = 2<em>n</em> divisors. If 2<em>n</em> divides <em>k</em> then
either <em>n</em> = 2 or <em>n</em> = <em>p</em> (as <em>n</em> is a prime).
If <em>n</em> = 2 then the perfect number is 6, which is not refactorable. If
<em>n</em> = <em>p</em> then <em>n</em> = 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>-1, which is impossible for
a prime <em>n</em>.
<br>
(b) <u>Odd perfect numbers.</u> No odd perfect numbers are known.
If one were to exist, say <em>q</em>, with divisors
<em>d</em><sub>1</sub> &lt; ... &lt; <em>d</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> = <em>q</em>, then each
<em>d</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> must be odd, and by definition, <em>d</em><sub>1</sub>+
... + <em>d</em><sub><em>k</em>-1</sub> = <em>q</em>. The sum of an even number of odd
integers is even, so, as <em>q</em> is odd, we know that <em>k</em>-1 must
be odd, so <em>q</em> has an even number of divisors. Therefore <em>q</em>
cannot be refactorable as it is odd and cannot be divisible by an even
number.
<font color="red">QED</font>.
<a name="pairs"></a>
</p><h3>2.2 Pairs and Triples of Refactorable Numbers</h3>

Because odd refactorables are square numbers, we cannot have
four or more consecutive refactorables, since
 positive squares always differ
by more than 2. We cannot yet rule out triples of refactorable
numbers, but we can show that it is very unlikely that they exist:

<p>
<strong>Theorem 4.</strong> If (<em>a</em>-1, <em>a</em>, <em>a</em>+1) is a triple of refactorable
numbers, then <em>a</em> must be of the form:
</p><p>
<img src="Refactorable%20Numbers%20-%20A%20Machine%20Invention_files/img1.gif">
<br>
for some integer <em>n</em>.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<strong> Proof.</strong> As odd refactorable numbers are square, and as no two
square numbers differ by 2, <em>a</em> must be odd and a square, say
<em>b</em><sup>2</sup>. An instance of the Fermat-Euler theorem (Theorem
72 from <a href="#hardy">[4]</a>) states that <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> = 1 (mod 4), so
<em>b</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2 (mod 4). Therefore <em>a</em> + 1 is not
divisible by 4 and so must have prime factorization <em>a</em> + 1 =
2 <em>p</em><sub>1</sub><sup><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></sup> ... 
<em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup><em>m</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></sup>,
where the <em>p<sub>i</sub></em>'s are distinct odd primes. This means
that <em>τ</em>(<em>a</em>+1) = 2(<em>m</em><sub>1</sub>+1)...(<em>m</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>+1) and that
each <em>m</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>+1 must be odd as <em>a</em>+1 is
refactorable. So each <em>m</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> must be even and therefore
<em>a</em>+1 is twice an odd square number. Therefore we can write <em>a</em>+1 =
2<em>c</em><sup>2</sup>,  so <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> + 1 = 2<em>c</em><sup>2</sup>. This means
that (<em>b</em>,<em>c</em>) must be a solution of the Diophantine equation
<em>x</em><sup>2</sup> - 2<em>y</em><sup>2</sup> = -1. Theorem 244 of <a href="#hardy">[4]</a>
states that the positive integer solutions to this equation are given by
</p><p><img src="Refactorable%20Numbers%20-%20A%20Machine%20Invention_files/img7.gif">
</p><p>for integers <em>n</em>.
Expanding the coefficient of <em>x</em> on the right-hand side, we get:
</p><p>
<img src="Refactorable%20Numbers%20-%20A%20Machine%20Invention_files/img2.gif">
</p><p>
and so <em>a</em> is as in the statement of the theorem.
<font color="red">QED</font>.

</p><p>
These numbers quickly become large. For example, if we take <em>n</em>
= 10, then <em>a</em> = 2982076586042449. By considering <em>n</em> &lt;= 35,
it is easy to show that there are no triples between 1 and
10<sup>53</sup>, and it would not be difficult to take this number further.
</p><p>
<strong>Conjecture 1.</strong> There are no triples of refactorable numbers.

</p><p>
There are, however, pairs of refactorable numbers, although these are
fairly rare. The only pairs of refactorable numbers between 1 and
1,000,000 are:

</p><p>
</p><hr>
<center>
[<a href="http://oeis.org/A036898">A036898</a>]:
(1 2), (8 9), (1520 1521), (50624 50625), (62000 62001), (103040 103041),
<br>(199808 199809), (221840 221841), (269360 269361), (463760
463761), (690560 690561), <br>(848240 848241), (986048 986049)
</center>
<hr>
<p></p>

<p>
It is easy to see that if (<em>a</em>, <em>a</em>+1) is a pair of
refactorable numbers, and <em>a</em> is even, then <em>a</em> is a
multiple of four (from the Fermat-Euler theorem as in the proof of
Theorem 4).
</p>

<p>
If two refactorables are relatively prime, their
product is also refactorable.  So the products of pairs of
consecutive refactorables produces another (possibly finite)
sequence of refactorables:
</p>

<p>
</p><center><hr>
[<a href="http://oeis.org/A036899">A036899</a>]:
2, 72, 2311920, 2562840000, 3844062000, 10617344640, 39923436672, ...
</center><hr>
<p>
<strong>Conjecture 2.</strong> There are infinitely many pairs of refactorable numbers.

<a name="distribution"></a>
</p><h3>2.3 Distribution</h3>
<p>
We cannot yet give an accurate measure for the number of
refactorables less than a given <em>n</em>, but we can say how many
there are with a given number of divisors:
</p><p>
<strong>Theorem 5.</strong> The number of refactorable numbers with <em>n</em>
divisors is:
</p><ul>
<li> 1, if <em>n</em> = 1 or 4.
</li>
<li> <em>k</em>!, if <em>n</em> is the product of <em>k</em> distinct primes
(ie. it is square-free:[<a href="http://www.research.att.com/cgi-bin/access.cgi/as/njas/sequences/eisA.cgi/?Anum=005117">A005117</a>]).
</li>
<li> infinite, otherwise.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Proof.</strong> Clearly, 1 is the only refactorable number with one
divisor. If an integer <em>s</em> has four divisors, then it must be of
the form <em>p</em><sup>3</sup> or <em>pq</em> for distinct primes <em>p</em>,
<em>q</em>. Taking the first case, if it is to be refactorable, then
<em>p</em> = 2 and the refactorable number is
8. There are no refactorables of the form <em>pq</em> because 4 cannot
divide the product of two distinct primes.
<br>
If <em>n</em> is the product of <em>k</em> distinct primes,
<em>n</em> = <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> ... <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>,
then any integer <em>s</em> with
<em>n</em> divisors must be of the form
<em>s</em> = <em>a</em><sub>1</sub><sup><em>p</em><sub>1</sub> - 1</sup> ... 
 <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup><em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> - 1</sup>
for distinct primes <em>a</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>. If it is
to be refactorable, then <em>n</em> must divide <em>s</em>, so
{<em>a</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>a</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>} = {<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>,
..., <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>} and there are <em>k</em>! ways to choose the
<em>a</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>'s from the <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>'s, hence <em>k</em>!
possibilities for <em>s</em>.
<br>
Suppose now that <em>n</em> is not square-free, and
<em>n</em> = <em>p</em><sub>1</sub><sup><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></sup> ... 
<em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup><em>m</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></sup>.
Firstly, if <em>k</em> = 1, then <em>n</em> = <em>p</em><sup><em>m</em></sup> and
<em>m</em> &gt; 1 . Then for any prime <em>q</em> which is not <em>p</em>, the
integer <em>s</em> = <em>q</em><sup><em>p</em> - 1</sup><em>p</em><sup><em>p</em><sup><em>m</em> - 1</sup> - 1</sup> has
<em>n</em> divisors. Further, <em>s</em> is refactorable unless
</p><p>
</p><center>
<em>p</em><sup><em>m</em> - 1</sup> - 1 &lt; <em>m</em> &lt;=&gt; <em>p</em> = <em>m</em> = 2 &lt;=&gt; <em>n</em> = 4 ,
</center>
<p>
and we have already dealt with the case where <em>n</em> = 4 .
Secondly, if <em>k</em> &gt; 1, with say <em>m</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> &gt; 1, for any
prime <em>q</em> not in {<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>}, the
integer
</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="Refactorable%20Numbers%20-%20A%20Machine%20Invention_files/img4.gif">
</center>
<p>
has <em>n</em> divisors. Now <em>s</em> is also refactorable unless, as
above, <em>p</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = <em>m</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> = 2. If there is an
<em>i</em> &gt; 2 for which <em>m</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> &gt; 1, then choosing this
<em>i</em> in the construction above works. This leaves only the case
where <em>n</em> = 2<sup>2</sup> <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> ... <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>. In this
case, for any prime <em>q</em> not in {<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>,
..., <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>}, the integer
</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="Refactorable%20Numbers%20-%20A%20Machine%20Invention_files/img5.gif">
</center>
<p>
has 2<em>p</em><sub>2</sub> 2<em>p</em><sub>3</sub> ... <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub> = <em>n</em> divisors,
and is refactorable because <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> &gt; 2  implies <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> - 1
&gt;=  2. <font color="red">QED</font>.

</p><p>
Theorem 5 tells us, for instance, that there are precisely two
refactorable numbers with 6 divisors, namely 12 and 18, and
precisely 6 refactorable numbers with 30 divisors, namely
2<sup>1</sup>3<sup>2</sup>5<sup>4</sup>,
2<sup>1</sup>3<sup>4</sup>5<sup>2</sup>,
2<sup>2</sup>3<sup>1</sup>5<sup>4</sup>,
2<sup>2</sup>3<sup>4</sup>5<sup>1</sup>,
2<sup>4</sup>3<sup>1</sup>5<sup>2</sup> and 
2<sup>4</sup>3<sup>2</sup>5<sup>1</sup>.

</p><p>
Also, for a given non-square-free integer 
<em>n</em> =
<em>p</em><sub>1</sub><sup><em>m</em><sub>1</sub></sup> ... <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub><sup><em>m</em><sub><em>k</em></sub></sup> ,
if we can write:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<em>n</em> =
(<em>m</em><sub>1</sub>+<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>) ... 
(<em>m</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>+<em>t</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>) <em>a</em><sub>1</sub> ... 
<em>a</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>
</center>
<p>
for <em>j</em> &gt; 0, and some <em>t</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> &gt; 0, <em>a</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>
&gt; 1, then for any set of primes, {<em>q</em><sub>1</sub>,
 ..., <em>q</em><sub><em>j</em></sub>}, none of which are in {<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>,
 ..., <em>p</em><sub><em>k</em></sub>}, the number:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<img src="Refactorable%20Numbers%20-%20A%20Machine%20Invention_files/img6.gif">
</center>
<p>
will have <em>n</em> divisors and be refactorable.

</p><p>
So, for instance, because 36 = 2<sup>2</sup> 3<sup>2</sup>,
</p><p>
36 = (2+1)(2+1)4 implies 36<em>p</em><sup>3</sup> has 36 divisors and is
refactorable (for any prime <em>p</em> &gt; 3).
<br>
36 = (2+1)(2+1)2*2  implies 36<em>p</em><em>q</em> has 36
divisors and is refactorable (for any primes <em>p</em>, <em>q</em> &gt; 3).
<br>
36 = (2+1)(2+2)3  implies 108<em>p</em><sup>2</sup> has 36 divisors and is
refactorable (for any prime <em>p</em> &gt; 3).
<br>
36 = (2+2)(2+1)3  implies 72<em>p</em><sup>2</sup> has 36 divisors and is
refactorable (for any prime <em>p</em> &gt; 3).
<br>
36 = (2+1)(2+4)2  implies 972<em>p</em> has 36 divisors and is
refactorable (for any prime <em>p</em> &gt; 3).
<br>
36 = (2+4)(2+1)2  implies 288<em>p</em> has 36 divisors and is
refactorable (for any prime <em>p</em> &gt; 3).

</p><p>
Note that the first such formula comes from the first
non-square-free integer greater than 4, namely 8, and we find that
8<em>p</em> is refactorable with 8 divisors, for any prime <em>p</em> &gt; 2.

</p><p>
To end the discussion on refactorable numbers, we give a table of
the distribution of (i) refactorable numbers, (ii) odd
refactorable numbers, (iii) even refactorable numbers, (iv) 
pairs of refactorable numbers, and we compare these with the
distribution of the primes and pairs of primes.

Table 1: Distribution of refactorable numbers, odd and
even refactorables and pairs of refactorables, compared with
distribution of primes and prime  pairs.
</center>

<p>
We used <a href="http://archives.math.utk.edu/software/msdos/number.theory/ubasic/.html">UBASIC</a>
and <a href="http://www-gap.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Egap/">GAP</a> to compile
this table. Based on this empirical evidence, it appears that the number
of refactorables is always at least half the number of primes. Using
the prime number theorem, (Theorem 6 of <a href="#hardy">[4]</a>), we can conjecture that
the number of refactorables less than <em>x</em> is at least <em>x</em>/(2 log(<em>x</em>)).

<u>3. HR - Automatic Concept Formation</u>
</h2>
<p>
The research of the author includes understanding and automating the
processes at work when mathematicians invent new concepts,
specifically in finite group theory. This has culminated in the
<a href="http://dream.dai.ed.ac.uk/group/simonco/hr/">HR</a>
system, named after <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Hardy.html">Hardy</a>
and
<a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/%7Ehistory/Mathematicians/Ramanujan.html">Ramanujan</a>, 
to emphasize both a theory-driven and a
data-driven approach to concept formation. HR starts with only the
axioms of group theory and ends with definitions and models of
concepts it has derived, such Abelian groups, cyclic groups, orders of
elements and so on. It does this by:
</p><ol>
<li>Finding models of groups using the MACE model finder, <a href="#Mace">[5]</a>.</li> <li>Storing data from the group tables
which details the core concepts in group theory, namely the group
operation, the identity element and the inverses of elements.</li>
<li>Manipulating this data in one of eight ways to produce a new
data-table from one (or two) old ones.</li> <li>Assigning definitions
to each new data-table using the information about how they were
constructed.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Most of the concepts HR invents are calculations which can be made
directly from the group table of a finite group. However, it also
makes sequences of groups, for instance, the sequence formed by
taking the subgroup generated by the center of the previous group
(which produces sequences of length two only).
The sequences produced were mostly disappointing. For
this reason, we looked towards number theory to see if it was possible
to find more interesting sequences using HR's limited set of production
rules.
</p><p>
<a name="number"></a>
</p><h3>3.1 HR Working in Number Theory</h3>
<p>
In number theory, HR generated three initial tables for the integers
up to 100:
</p><ul>
<li>The set of triples [<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>] for which <em>a</em> = <em>b</em> * <em>c</em>.
</li>
<li>The set of triples [<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>] for which <em>a</em> = <em>b</em> + <em>c</em>.
</li>
<li>The set of pairs [<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>] for which <em>b</em> is a digit in the
decimal expansion of <em>a</em>.
</li>
</ul>
These were quite arbitrary choices
- other choices would lead to different concepts.
HR performs concept formation in number theory using the
same manipulations as in group theory. It also has three ways to
produce sequences of numbers:
<ol>
<li>By taking the sequence of integers with a given property,
e.g. the  prime numbers.</li>
<li>By taking the output of some function on successive integers,
e.g. the <em>τ</em> function.</li>
<li>By finding those integers which, for some function, output an
integer larger than any output for a smaller integer, i.e. those
integers which set a record, such as the highly composite numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first time HR was tried in number theory, it invented the
refactorable numbers. When we first saw this sequence, we did not know
how it was found, but it looked interesting - it had a mix of odd and even
numbers, sufficiently many terms between one and a hundred, and no obvious
pattern. Therefore we looked it up in the 
<a href="http://oeis.org/">Online Encyclopedia</a>,
and were
surprised to find that it was not listed. Only then did we look at
the output from HR to see its definition
(expecting an unintuitive, complicated explanation), and
were then even more surprised that this sequence was missing from the
Encyclopedia.

</p><p>
We must point out that HR did only the easy part - it invented the
concept - we have done all the rest of the above work. However,
HR does make conjectures about refactorables. For example, it made
the following conjecture, which we thought was true until a very large
counterexample was found:

</p><p>
<strong>Conjecture.</strong>
Given a refactorable number <em>n</em>, let
<br><br>
</p><center>
<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = |{(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) in <strong>N</strong> × <strong>N</strong> :
<em>a</em><em>b</em> = <em>n</em>, <em>a</em> =\= <em>b</em>}| .
</center>
<br>
Then <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) is <strong> not </strong> a divisor of <em>n</em> if and only if <em>n</em> is a square number. 

<p>
<strong>Proof of [==&gt;] </strong>
Suppose <em> n </em> is refactorable, that <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) does not divide
<em> n </em> and that <em> n </em> is <strong> not </strong> a square.
Then <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) is equal to
the number of divisors of <em> n</em>, and so must divide <em>n</em>, a contradiction.
<br>
<strong>Disproof of [&lt;==]</strong>
36360900, 79388100 and 155600676 are the first three
square refactorable number which are divisible by
<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>).
</p><p>

Since HR only knew the
factorizations of the integers up to 100, the conjecture was not implausible.
</p><p>

Note that there can be no odd refactorable
numbers <em>n</em> for which <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) divides <em> n</em>,
because if <em> n </em> is odd and refactorable, it must be a square, and
if so, <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) is one less than the number of divisors of <em>n</em>,
 so, as <em> n </em> is refactorable, <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) + 1 must
divide <em> n</em>, and as <em> n </em> is odd, we cannot have both 
<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) and <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) + 1 dividing <em> n</em>, as one of these
must be even.
</p><p>

We note that HR has in effect discovered the concept of square
numbers, for which both <em>τ</em>(<em>n</em>) and <em>τ</em>(<em>n</em>)-1
divide <em>n</em>.

</p><p>
The odd or even square refactorable numbers are:

</p><h3>3.2 Recent Developments</h3>

<h3>3.2.1 Data Mining Using the Encyclopedia</h3>

<p>
Having down-loaded a copy of the
<a href="http://oeis.org/">Online Encyclopedia</a>,
we have enabled HR
to check each sequence it makes against the database and flag those
which it has reinvented. After tidying up the data, we were also able
to write an add-on program enabling HR to perform some data mining
with the encyclopedia. We are still implementing, experimenting and
collating results, but it seems that it is certainly possible to find
previously unknown results using data mining. For example, we asked HR
to identify any sequences for which the refactorables are a
subsequence. It first found [<a href="http://oeis.org/A009230">A009230</a>],
in which the <em>n</em>th term is
lcm(<em>n</em>, <em>d</em>(<em>n</em>)), which was not too
surprising since for every refactorable number <em>r</em>,
lcm(<em>r</em>, <em>τ</em>(<em>r</em>)) = <em>r</em>.

</p><p>
Next, HR spotted that the refactorables are a subsequence of [<a href="http://oeis.org/A047466">A047466</a>], the integers congruent to 0, 1, 2
or 4 (mod 8). This was an unknown result, which we subsequently
proved:
</p><p>
<strong>Theorem 6. </strong> Refactorable numbers are congruent to 0, 1, 2 or 4 (mod 8).
</p><p>
<strong>Proof.</strong> 
Odd refactorables are squares, and therefore congruent to 1 modulo 8.
If a refactorable
number were congruent to 6 mod 8 then it would be of the form 
2(4<em>n</em>+3), and by Lemma 2, 4<em>n</em>+3 would  also be
refactorable, a contradiction.
<font color="red">QED</font>.
</p><p>
This gives us another insight into triples of refactorables:
</p><p>
<strong>Corollary.</strong> If (<em>a</em>-1, <em>a</em>, <em>a</em>+1) is a triple of refactorable
numbers, then <em>a</em> = <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> for some odd number <em>b</em> and
<em>b</em><sup>2</sup> = 16<em>c</em> + 1 for some <em>c</em>.
</p><p>
<strong>Proof.</strong> By Theorem 6, odd refactorables are congruent to 1
(mod 8), hence <em>a</em>+1 = 8<em>n</em> + 2 = 2(4<em>n</em> + 1) for some <em>n</em>. Therefore,
as <em>a</em> + 1 is refactorable and 4<em>n</em> + 1 is odd, we see by Lemma
2 that 4<em>n</em> + 1 is an odd refactorable number. Hence, by Theorem 6
again, 4<em>n</em> + 1 = 8<em>c</em>+1, so <em>a</em> + 1 = 2(8<em>c</em>+1) and we see that
<em>a</em> = 16<em>c</em>+1. As <em>a</em> is an odd refactorable, by Theorem 2 we
can write <em>a</em> = <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> for some <em>b</em>, and
<em>a</em> = <em>b</em><sup>2</sup> = 16<em>c</em>+1. <font color="red">QED</font>.
</p><p>
Another data mining investigation using the encyclopedia, this time to find
super-sequences of the perfect numbers ["even" being understood here],
showed that perfect numbers are
a subsequence of [<a href="http://oeis.org/A009242">A009242</a>],
with <em>n</em>th term equal to
lcm(<em>n</em>, <em>σ</em>(<em>n</em>)).  Therefore HR had spotted that, for all (even)
perfect numbers <em>p</em>, there is an <em>n</em> such that
lcm(<em>n</em>, <em>σ</em>(<em>n</em>)) = <em>p</em>. In the same session, HR also spotted that
the even perfect numbers are a subsequence of [<a href="http://oeis.org/A007517">A007517</a>], in which the <em>n</em>th term is
<em>φ</em>(<em>n</em>)(<em>σ</em>(<em>n</em>)-<em>n</em>).  We have subsequently proved both of these
results:
</p><p>
<strong>Theorem 7. </strong> For any even perfect number <em>p</em>, there is an integer
<em>a</em> for which lcm(<em>a</em>, <em>σ</em>(<em>a</em>)) = <em>p</em>, and an integer
<em>b</em> for which <em>φ</em>(<em>b</em>)(<em>σ</em>(<em>b</em>)-<em>b</em>) = <em>p</em>.
</p><p>
<strong>Proof.</strong> From Theorem 277 of <a href="#hardy">[4]</a>, we note that
<em>p</em> = 2<sup><em>n</em> - 1</sup> (2<sup><em>n</em></sup>-1) for some <em>n</em>, where
2<sup><em>n</em></sup>-1 is a prime. If we take <em>a</em> = 2<sup><em>n</em>-1</sup> then
</p><center>
<em>σ</em>(<em>a</em>) = 1 + 2 + ... + 2<sup><em>n</em>-1</sup> = 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> - 1
</center>
and so lcm(<em>a</em>, <em>σ</em>(<em>a</em>)) = 2<sup><em>n</em>-1</sup> (2<sup><em>n</em></sup>-1) = <em>p</em>,
because 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>-1 is prime. <br>
If we take
<em>b</em> = 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> then <em>σ</em>(<em>b</em>) = 2<sup><em>n</em> + 1</sup>-1 and only
the odd integers less than <em>b</em> will be coprime to it, so
<center>
<em>φ</em>(<em>b</em>) = <em>b</em>/2 = 2<sup><em>n</em>-1</sup>
</center>
Therefore
<center>
<em>φ</em>(<em>b</em>)(<em>σ</em>(<em>b</em>) - <em>b</em>) = 2<sup><em>n</em>-1</sup> (2<sup><em>n</em> + 1</sup>
- 1 - 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>)
= 2<sup><em>n</em> - 1</sup> (2<sup><em>n</em></sup> - 1) = <em>p</em>.</center>
<font color="red">QED</font>.
<p>
So HR has highlighted the following appealing parallel
between the refactorable numbers and the even perfect numbers:
</p><ul>
<li>Refactorable numbers are of the form lcm(<em>a</em>, <em>τ</em>(<em>a</em>)) for some
<em>a</em>.
</li>
<li>Perfect numbers are of the form lcm(<em>a</em>, <em>σ</em>(<em>a</em>)) for some
<em>a</em>.
</li>
</ul>
We also note that
<ul>
<li>Refactorable numbers are those <em>n</em> for which lcm(<em>n</em>, <em>τ</em>(<em>n</em>))  =  <em>n</em>,</li>
<li>Perfect numbers are those <em>n</em> for which lcm(<em>n</em>, <em>σ</em>(<em>n</em>)) = 2<em>n</em>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2.2 A Mathematical Cycle</h3>

We have recently been able to complete a cycle of mathematical
activities by using the automated theorem prover OTTER <a href="#Otter">[6]</a> to prove some of the conjectures that HR makes in group
theory. HR now:
<ul>
<li>Invents definitions</li>
<li>Spots conjectures involving those definitions</li>
<li>Proves some of the conjectures using OTTER</li>
<li>Finds counterexamples to some of the conjectures that OTTER fails to prove</li>
</ul>
Therefore, starting with only the axioms of group theory, HR
constructs a theory with (i) examples of groups, (ii) definitions of
groups and models of those definitions, (iii) proven conjectures with
proofs supplied by OTTER, (iv) open conjectures, where OTTER has
failed to find a proof and MACE has failed to find a counterexample.

system, and the following web page is devoted to HR:

After a preliminary examination, we can claim that HR reinvented the

</ul>
</ol>
<p>
More interesting than the fact that HR reinvented these sequences are
the ways in which HR defines them. For example, even numbers
are defined as integers <em>n</em> for which there is a natural number
<em>m</em> such that <em>m</em> + <em>m</em> = <em>n</em>. The natural numbers in base 3
were defined as integers in base 10 which have no digits which can be
written as <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> where <em>a</em> &gt; 0, <em>b</em> &gt; 0 and <em>a</em> =/=
<em>b</em>. Powers of two were defined as those integers with no
odd divisors.
</p><p>
</p><h3>4.2 <a name="newseqs">New Sequences Invented by HR</a></h3>
<p>
HR invented many other sequences which were not found in the
encyclopedia.
Most did not seem of any great interest.  However,
we deemed the following seven of sufficient
interest to be submitted to the encyclopedia.
</p><ol>
<li>1, 2, 14, 23, 29, 34, 46, 63, 68, 74, 76, 78, 88, 94, ... [<a href="http://oeis.org/A036433">A036433</a>],

the number of divisors is a digit in the decimal expansion of n.
This sequence contains all primes with a 2 in them, and those primes
starting with a 2, [<a href="http://oeis.org/A045708">A045708</a>].

<br>
integers which cannot be written as <em>a</em> + <em>τ</em>(<em>a</em>) for some

<li>1, 2, 7, 38, 122, 2766, 64686, ... [<a href="http://oeis.org/A036432">A036432</a>],
<br>
integers that set a record for <em>f</em>(<em>n</em>).

</p></li>
<li>1, 4, 6, 10, 12, 14, 22, 24, 26, 27, ... [<a href="http://oeis.org/A036438">A036438</a>],
<br>
integers which can be written as <em>m</em> * <em>τ</em>(<em>m</em>) for some
<em>m</em> (which of course include twice the primes, [<a href="http://oeis.org/A001747">A001747</a>]).
<p>
</p></li>
<li>1, 6, 8, 10, 14, 15, 22, 26, 27, ... [<a href="http://oeis.org/A036436">A036436</a>],
<br>
integers for which <em>τ</em>(<em>n</em>) is a square. This sequence
contains the multiplicatively perfect numbers

<p>
HR has also found some interesting finite sequences of integers. For example, HR
invented those integers which have more distinct digits than any

<u>5. Conclusions</u>
</h2>
We have shown that refactorable numbers are of some interest, and hope
that someone will take up the challenge of proving the conjectures
from this paper (before we do).
<p>
Also, we have shown that HR is capable of producing interesting concepts.
Automated concept formation programs have some advantages over humans,
in that they have no pride (are not ashamed to look at concepts with
simple descriptions) and are very thorough. The use of
computers with integer sequences has also been explored in <a href="#meredith">[7]</a>, where the Seek-Whence program was used to
identify definitions of integer sequences. Indeed, the 
<a href="http://oeis.org/ol.html">Superseeker</a>
server for the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences does a certain
amount of concept formation in attempting to find a match between a given sequence
and one in the database. A similar program to HR is Graffiti, <a href="#fajtlowicz">[3]</a>, which makes conjectures in graph
theory.
Another program, <a href="#bagai">[1]</a>, automatically invents
theorems in plane geometry.
</p><p>
Machine discovery in mathematics and in science in general is a
productive and interesting area which is gaining 
recognition and attention. HR and refactorable numbers were themselves
recently mentioned in the popular press, <a href="#newscientist">[8]</a>, which reflects the interest that machine
discovery is attracting. As more work is done in this area, we hope to
make discovery programs as much a part of the mathematician's tool box
as computer algebra packages.

<p>
In this paper we tried
to make two points: (i) that the HR program we have implemented can
invent new and interesting concepts in number theory and (ii) that one
concept output by HR, namely the refactorable numbers, had many
interesting properties. Because refactorables and associated sequences
were missing from the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, <a href="#sloane">[9]</a>, and after a preliminary search of the relevant
literature, we concluded that the refactorable numbers were a
genuinely new invention.
</p><p align="justify">
However, on 23rd March 1999, we received notification from
 <a href="http://www.math-cs.cmsu.edu/%7Edept/faculty/kennedy.html">Robert
Kennedy</a> and <a href="http://www.math-cs.cmsu.edu/%7Edept/faculty/cooper.html">Curtis
Cooper</a>, of Central Missouri State University, that they had read
the above paper and that the concept of refactorables had been defined
already as `τ numbers' in a 1990 paper, <a href="#kennedy">[10]</a>,
which proved that the natural density of the τ numbers is zero.
</p><p align="justify">
This news detracts from our original paper in only one way, namely
that the title is inaccurate, refactorables were a machine
re-invention. Indeed, the news that they have been developed so
recently adds both to the point that HR can invent and re-invent
concepts of interest and, of course, to the point that refactorables
are interesting.

</p><p align="justify">
To add to the argument that HR produces interesting, novel concepts in
number theory, we present the following very simple function defined
by HR recently:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<em>f</em>(<em>n</em>) = |{(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>) : <em>a</em> * <em>b</em> = <em>n</em> and <em>a</em> | <em>b</em>}|.
</center>
<p>
This has been added to the encyclopedia:

<hr>
</center>
<p align="justify">
This was interesting because of its similarity to the τ function,
[<a href="http://oeis.org/A000005">A000005</a>]:
(<em>τ(n) = </em> number of divisors of <em>n</em>). HR went on to
define the integer sequence of numbers which set a record for <em>f</em>
(ie. those integers, <em>a</em>, for which for all <em>b, 0 &lt; b &lt; a, f(a)
&gt; f(b)</em>): <br><br>

<p align="justify">
It was easy to spot that these are all square numbers, but a little
investigating revealed the following result:
</p><p align="justify">
<strong>Theorem 1.</strong> The nth integer setting the record for <em>f</em> as
above is the square of the nth highly composite number [<a href="http://oeis.org/A002182">A002182</a>] (the highly composite
numbers have more divisors than any smaller integer).
</p><p align="justify">
To prove this, we need the following lemma:
</p><p align="justify">
<strong> Lemma 1.</strong> <em>f(n) = τ(square root of the largest square
dividing n)</em>. Note that the square root of the largest square
dividing <em>n</em>, which we write as <em>s(n)</em>, is integer sequence
[<a href="http://oeis.org/A000188">A000188</a>].
</p><p align="justify">
<strong> Proof of Lemma 1.</strong>
<br>
Writing
<em>n=p<sub>1</sub><sup>k<sub>1</sub></sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>k<sub>m</sub></sup></em>,
the largest square dividing <em>n</em> is
<em>p<sub>1</sub><sup>2[k<sub>1</sub>/2]</sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>2[k<sub>m</sub>/2]</sup></em>,
the square root of which is:
<em>p<sub>1</sub><sup>[k<sub>1</sub>/2]</sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>[k<sub>m</sub>/2]</sup></em>,
where <em>[z]</em> denotes the integer part of fraction <em>z</em>. The
pairs of integers dividing <em>n</em> are of the form:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<em>(a,b) =
(p<sub>1</sub><sup>x<sub>1</sub></sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>x<sub>m</sub></sup>,
p<sub>1</sub><sup>k<sub>1</sub> -
x<sub>1</sub></sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>k<sub>m</sub> - x<sub>m</sub></sup>)</em>
</center>
<p align="justify">and <em>a|b</em> if for all <em>i, x<sub>i</sub> =&lt; k<sub>i</sub> -
x<sub>i</sub></em>, ie. <em>x<sub>i</sub> =&lt; k<sub>i</sub>/2</em>. Therefore,
each <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> can be <em>0,1,2,...,[k<sub>i</sub>/2]</em>,
and:
</p><p>
</p><center>
<em>f(n) = ([k<sub>1</sub>/2] + 1)([k<sub>2</sub>/2] +
1)...([k<sub>m</sub>/2] + 1) =
τ(p<sub>1</sub><sup>[k<sub>1</sub>/2]</sup>...p<sub>m</sub><sup>[k<sub>1</sub>/2]</sup>)
= τ(s(n)),</em>
</center>
<p align="justify">
using Theorem 273 from <a href="#hardy">[4]</a>.

</p><p align="justify">
<strong>Proof of Theorem 1.</strong>
<br>
Suppose that <em>a</em> sets a record for <em>f</em>. Therefore, <em>f(a) &gt;
f(1), f(a) &gt; f(2), ..., f(a) &gt; f(a-1)</em>, and by lemma 1, this means
that <em>τ(s(a)) &gt; τ(s(1)), τ(s(a)) &gt; τ(s(2)), ..., τ(s(a)) &gt;
τ(s(a-1))</em>. Suppose now that <em>c<sup>2</sup></em> is the largest
square less than or equal to <em>a</em>. Then we see that: </p><p></p><center>
<em>τ(s(a)) &gt; τ(s(1)) = τ(1) <br>τ(s(a)) &gt; τ(s(4)) = τ(2)
<br> . &nbsp; &nbsp; .<br>τ(s(a)) &gt; τ(s((c-1)<sup>2</sup>)) =
τ(c-1) </em></center><p align="justify">If <em>a &gt; c<sup>2</sup></em>,
the largest square dividing <em>a</em> will be less than
<em>c<sup>2</sup></em> and <em>s(a) &lt; c</em>. But then, <em>s(a) = c -
k</em> for some <em>k</em>, and <em>τ(s(a)) = τ(c-k)</em>, which is a
contradiction. Hence <em>a = c<sup>2</sup>, s(a) = c,</em> and <em>τ(c)
&gt; τ(c - i)</em> for all <em>i &lt; c</em>, which makes <em>c</em> a highly
composite number, and <em>a</em> the square of a highly composite
number.
</p><p align="justify">
Suppose now that <em>b</em> is a highly composite number, and
<em>a=b<sup>2</sup></em>. Therefore, <em>s(a) = b</em>, and, as <em>b</em>
is highly composite, if, for some <em>k, τ(s(a-k)) &gt;
τ(s(a))</em>, then <em>s(a-k) &gt; s(a) = b,</em> which is
impossible. Hence, for all <em>k &lt; a, τ(s(a)) &gt; τ(s(a - k))</em>, and by
lemma 1, <em>f(a) &gt; f(a - k)</em>, thus <em>a</em> sets a
record for <em>f</em>. <font color="red">QED</font>
</p><p align="justify">
Coincidentally, the previous time there was a similar confusion over a
machine invented concept, Douglas Lenat, who wrote the AM program, <a href="#lenat">[11]</a>, thought for a while that what he called
maximally divisible numbers were a machine invention. These turned out
to be the highly composite numbers we've discussed here, which were
originally developed by Ramanujan, <a href="#ramanujan">[12]</a>.
</p><p align="justify">
This time, we will only claim that it is possible that the function
<em>f</em> above was invented by HR, and that it is possible that, while
the concept of the squares of highly composite numbers may have been
looked at before, HR may have been the first to define them as setting
the record for <em>f</em>. It was fortunate that τ numbers had not
been added to the encyclopedia, because we may have decided not to
develop them. However, the story of refactorable/τ numbers
emphasises the need for databases of mathematical knowledge such as
the Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, <a href="#sloane">[9]</a>,
which can be used by people and computers alike to check the novelty
of inventions.
