<TITLE> HR - Automatic Theory Formation in Pure Mathematics </TITLE>

<META name="description" content="The HR program written by Simon
Colton constructs a mathematical theory by inventing definitions,
performing calculations, making conjectures and proving or disproving
those conjectures. It works in number theory, graph theory and any
finite algebra such as group theory and ring theory. There are plans
to extend this list. It has been responsible for the invention of many
new integer sequences, and is presently being applied to constraint
satisfaction, theorem proving and automatic conjecture making for
mathematicians.">
