<h2>9. USING HR - A BRIEF GUIDE</h2>
<font color="red">Subsections:</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="#hr_output">Output from HR</a>
<p align="justify">
We are working on a java version of HR which will be much easier to
use, and before that, a java front end which will enable the user to
specify parameters, run sessions, etc., more easily. At present, HR is
a prolog program written in sicstus objects, and to use it properly,
the Otter, MACE, LaTeX, Dot and xgraph programs are also needed.

<a name="hr_input"></a>
</p><h2>Giving Input to HR</h2>

<p align="justify">
The more initial information about a theory the user can give, the
more HR can do. Here are some of the things a user can specify:
</p><ul>
<li><font color="green">Axioms.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;These are necessary if
any theorem proving is to be done.</li>
<li><font color="green">How to Generate Models.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;This
will enable HR to perform its own counterexample finding.</li>
<li><font color="green">Initial Concepts.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;If the user
is interested in any particular concepts, they can provide them in
advance.</li>
<li><font color="green">Search Strategy Parameters.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;See below</li>
<li><font color="green">Tasks to Achieve.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;For example,
if the user is looking for a concept which provides a particular
categorisation, then the categorisation must be given.</li>
<li><font color="green">Output Choices</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;ie. how to
present the output.</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
There are many ways to influence the search HR performs. Some of the
many parameters that the user can set are:
</p><ul>
<li>Which production rules to use.</li>
<li>A complexity cap (usually less than 10).</li>
<li>When to sort the concepts and conjectures (usually after every
10th new concept).</li>
<li>When to attempt to settle conjectures (usually when first
seen).</li>
<li>How to sort the concepts and conjectures, ie. how to weight the
measures.</li>
<li>How to approach theorem proving (usually: HR first, Otter
second).</li>
<li>How long to spend finding proofs and counterexamples.</li>
<li>How many counterexamples to find for each conjecture (usually just 
one).</li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">
At present, setting parameters has to be done on the command line,
with commands such as: <tt>?- cycle::set(sort_when(30)).</tt> which
tells HR to start sorting its concepts after the 30th has been
introduced. Some more complicated sets of commands can be put into a 
`modes' file which HR can read.

<a name="running_hr"></a>
</p><h2>Running HR</h2>

<p align="justify">
Once the user has set all the necessary parameters, usually HR is run
completely autonomously. Users can, if they wish, interrupt the
process and re-set the parameters, but this is not usual. To run HR,
it needs to be given a target, something to achieve. For example, it
could be asked to produce 100 conjectures, or 200 concepts. The list
of things to ask for includes:

</p><ul>
<li>Time, eg. to construct a theory for a given number of
minutes.</li>
<li>Concepts</li>
<li>Conjectures</li>
<li>Theorems</li>
<li>Models</li>
<li>Categorisations</li>
<li>Classifications (ie. the gold standard, given by the user).</li>
<li>Prime implicants</li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
To start HR running, the user simply types
<tt>construct(30,minutes).</tt>, etc. (if they want HR to work for
half an hour). It is sometimes a good idea to change strategies half
way through a session, and I often find myself asking HR to run for a
certain time in one mode and then to complete the session in another
mode. For example, if looking for a concept which classifies up to
order 6, the classifying mode often specialises too early. Therefore,
I usually run HR for 10 minutes in exhaustive mode (to cover the
basics), then 10 minutes in novelty mode (to produce many different
categorisations), then I finally change to classifying mode. In this
case, the commands to run HR would be:
</p><p align="center">
</p><pre>?- set_mode(exhaustive), construct(10,minutes),
   set_mode(novelty), construct(10,minutes),
   set_mode(classifying), construct(1,classification).
</pre>


<a name="hr_output"></a>
<h2>Understanding HR's Output</h2>
<p align="justify">
Once HR has finished forming a theory, the user can employ some tools
to understand and choose between the concepts that HR has come up
with. Firstly, the user can look for concepts of a particular
type. For example, in number theory, they may want to look for
concepts which are number types. These will have tables with only one
column, so the user looks for concepts with arity 1. They can use this
in conjunction with one of many print commands, which will print to
screen. Eg.

</p><pre><font color="green">
?- concept(A)::arity(1), A&gt;20, print::fol(A).
[I] s.t. 2 = |{(a) : a|I}|
A = 21 ? ;
[I] s.t. 3 = |{(a) : a|I}|
A = 22 ? ;
.
.
.
[I] s.t. 2 = |{(a) : a|I}| &amp; -(I = |{(b) : b|I}|)
A = 43 ?

yes
?- print::table(43).

| 3  || 5  || 7  || 11 || 13 || 17 || 19 |
yes
</font></pre>
<p align="justify">
There are also some other, more graphical, ways to explore HR's
concepts. For example, if the user were interested in how the average
complexity of the concepts had changed over the course of the theory,
they could type:
</p><p>
<tt>?- view::concept_statistics(average,complexity).</tt>
</p><p>
and they would be presented with this graph:
</p><p>
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics9_files/100_complex.html" width="100%">
</p><p align="justify">
which shows how the given concepts have complexity 1, but as the
theory progresses, the average complexity increases to nearly
5.5. Note that graphs of this type are produced using the xgraph
package. 

</p><p align="justify">
There are other graphs which HR can draw, using the DOT package from
AT&amp;T. If the user is interested in the construction history of a
concept or concepts, they can ask for a graphical representation of
how the concepts were constructed. For example, if interested in
concepts 77,88 and 99, the user could type:
</p><p>
<tt>?- view::graph([77,88,99]).</tt>
</p><p>
and they would be presented with this graph:
</p><p>
<img src="HR%20-%20Automatic%20Theory%20Formation%20In%20Pure%20Mathematics9_files/778899.html">
</p><p align="justify">
Finally, the user can ask HR to write and mark up a LaTeX script in a
human-readable format. This aspect of HR's functionality is in need of
an overhaul, and at present doesn't work correctly. Here are some
examples from around September 1998, of HR's LaTeX output. Note that
the HR project has moved on considerably since these were produced.
