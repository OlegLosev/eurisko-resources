Description
The Amelie’s Progress Gallery pays homage to the fine acting skills of Audrey Tatou in the film Amelie, where she
portrays a range of emotions. The gallery contains 222 portraits of the actress which were generated automatically by
The Painting Fool. From left to right, the emotions portrayed
range from very sad to very happy, and the painting styles
fit this scheme. The gallery also contains 24 short video sequences of The Painting Fool producing the portraits.
The Imaginations #1 Gallery is a work in progress, and
currently contains three large, multi-faceted images. Firstly,
there is a (simulated) pastel and pencil painting of a wreathlike arrangement of flowers. Secondly, there is a (simulated) pastel and pencil painting of Madrid, which consists
of dozens of paintings of buildings taken from Google’s 3D
Warehouse, arranged shambolically to create an overall disorienting effect. There is a similar (simulated) pencil sketch
of London.
Artist Statement
With each new gallery produced by The Painting Fool (in
collaboration with me), its abilities expand to include more
behaviours exhibited by artists. With the Amelie’s Progress
gallery, The Painting Fool was trained to appreciate how its
painting styles can heighten the emotional content of a portrait. To do this, I developed an expert system to map key-

words such as ‘happy’ or ‘sad’ onto painting styles (which
include colour palettes, abstraction levels, natural media
choices, etc). With the Imaginations #1 gallery, I’m expanding The Painting Fool’s abilities to create and paint scenes
from its imagination (inspired by Cohen’s AARON program), for example by using evolutionary techniques.
Artist’s Biography
Simon Colton is a senior lecturer in computing at Imperial College, London. He researches the development and
application of Artificial Intelligence techniques for creative
tasks such as mathematical invention, scientific discovery
and painting. In the last five years, he has embarked upon
a personal odyssey to build an automated painter called The
Painting Fool. It is his intention that The Painting Fool is
eventually taken seriously as a creative artist in its own right.
To achieve this, he is equipping The Painting Fool with behaviours which are skilful, appreciative and imaginative.
The Painting Fool’s city series of artworks was presented
at the 2006 Computer Generated Artworks exhibition, and
a live demonstration was given at the Darwin Festival in
Shrewsbury. By combining The Painting Fool with an emotion detection system (also developed at Imperial), the team
won the BCS Machine Intelligence Competition in December 2007.
