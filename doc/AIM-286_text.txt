ABSTRACT
The FINDSPACE problem is that of establishing a volume in space where an object of specified dimensions will fit. The problera seems to have two subproblens:
the hypothesis generation problem of finding a likely spot to try, and the
verification problem of testing that spot for occupancy by other objects.
This paper treats primarily the verification problem.

Work reported herein was conducted at the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory,
a Massachusetts Institute of Technology research program supported by the
Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense, and was
monitored by the Office of Naval Research under Contract Number N00014-70A-Q362-0002,

The FINDSPACE problea is a computationally hairy but well-defined subproblem of the robot problea.
in

The genesis of the problem naae is a function

Terry Winograd's block manipulation program-

This function assumes a

model of the world consisting of a table with bricks piled on it and takes

arguments describing an object to be added to the scone by placing it on a
specified surface (either the table or the top of an existing block).

If

there is room on the specified surface for the given block* FINDSPACE returns a specification of the available space.
the FINDSPACE function returns NIL.

If there is no available space,

Associated with the FINDSPACE program must

be routines to update the data base, i.e. the environmental model, when an

object is moved In, added to, or removed from the scene.

Indeed, since these

routines will be called relatively rarely compared with accessing of the
data base, it is reasonable that they be expensive and compute a complex

representation of the object whose status is being codified if this oakes
FINDSPACE sufficiently easier.

I

became involved in the FINDSPACE problem

because Terry's program has certain restrictions (which

I

will described

later) which aake it fairly useless for dealing with real world situations.
In the real world, a FINDSPACE solution, though it may be heuristic,

mist be conservative.

That is, it must not make the mistake of finding

space when there is none, though it may be occasionally wrong by failing
to find space when there is some.

This is the case because the robot hand

may be damaged by attempting to push one object through another.

This die-

tun can best be understood by realizing that the stubbing of a toe reflects a
failure of the human FINDSPACE.

The FINDSPACE problem has several subproblems to be solved.

How do we

represent the objects in the world model so that it is possible to solve the

problem with a reasonable degree of efficiency?

How can we propose a likely

space for an object?

And given a proposed likely space, how can we verify

its safety to the desired degree of conservativeness without rejecting too

many good answers?

Thus the FlNDSPACE program may be divided into two sub-

a proposer and a verifier,

routines:

will take a short excursion into the realm of proposers.

The

simplest proposer (which is employed in tfinograd's program) is a random
solution generator.

It generates solutions randomly, constrained only by

the input data (the object and the surface to put it on) without regard to
the model.

to a free storage list in a storage allocation system for a computer.

The

haven't seen any scheme for doing this that

doesn't become very fragmented quickly.

Another possible scheme (currently

implemented by Eugene Freuder) is a division of space into a set of buckets
which are marked when they are occupied; thus only proposals of unmarked

buckets may be made.
Getting to the verifier, various restrictions may be imposed on

problem to make it more tractable.

the

In Winograd's program, for example, the

only objects allowed are rectangular prisms, hereafter called bricks (he
does allow pyramids, but from FINDSPACE's point of view they arc bricks con-

taining the pyramids), with all dimensions parallel to the coordinate axes;
furthermore, no brick may ever be rotated.

it

This model is too restricted for

cannot expect to find its world all lined up

In this model an object is represented as a single point (the lower,

forward, lefthand corner) and a set of dimensions (length, width, and depth}.

The central function in Kinograd's verifier is a function called GROW, which

takes a proposed point and grows it along the direction of the coordinate axes
to become a rectangle of maximal size which intersects no other object.

then tests the size of the result to see if

it

It

fits the given object, and

if it does it returns the center of the grown region.
I

have written a verifier, called RCLEAR(recursive clear), which allows

the model to contain bricks in any orientation, thus relaxing the most im-

portant restriction of the previous program.

Ei is a list (d v), where d is

El, E2, E3 represent the edges of the brick.

the square of the length of the corresponding edge and v is the unit vector

pointing in that direction*

The general philosophy of RCLEAR is:

in order

to determine if the given object could fit in the given place in the scene,

imagine it in place and check if it intersects any other object.

The

critical function here is one called DISJOINT 1, which takes two representations of bricks and returns T if they are disjoint and NIL otherwise.

If neither test is passed, there is uncertainty in the result,

and to remove this uncertainty we must apply a finer filter.

Note how clever this algorithm is; if at any level it can decide
immediately that the objects are disjoint by applying a gross test, it does
so.

Furthermore, the recursion lets it zero in on the trouble spot very fast.

For example, if the bricks are close together at one end of one of them,

then it will recurse deeply only on subbricks at that end.

Another thing to

note is that each test is very fast, so it never considers very long two
bricks at opposite ends of the tabic or obviously overlapping.

parameter (a free variable called FUZEPS (the epsilon of fyzriness)}

which it compares to the length of the maximum edge before it recurses and
if MAX<FUZEPS it conservatively returns failure.

This also makes FINDSPACE

somewhat hairier because it must avoid applying DISJ0INT1 to the proposed
spot and the brick whose surface we are finding space on.

Another problem with RCLEAR is that it too is severely restricted in
that it only works for bricks and would be difficult to extend to other classes

of objects.

Ke could write a version of DISJ0IOT1 which worked for tetra-

hedra, since it is very easy to calculate the circumscribed and inscribed

spheres of a tetrahedron*

Furthermore, a tetrahedron can be split easily

into totrahedra, making the recursive step possible.

Since any polyhedron

nay be triangulated into tetrahedra, it becomes possible to represent any

polyhedron as a union of tetrahedra.

Thus two polyhedra are disjoint if and

only if all the pairwise combinations of a tetrahedron from each are disjoint.

This is very general but it suffers from the disadvantage that the algorithm to
triangulate an object may be in general very hairy.

This is not so terrible

if we are dealing with many objects because the data base building function

may be arbitrarily expensive since most objects are stationary.

Another dis-

advantage is that an object such as a brick will be represented by say 5
(I

do not know if this is minimal) tetrahedra, and thus a new program would

be perhaps 25 times as expensive as RCLEAR.

Although this is only a con-

stant factorj it looks pretty bad to me.
Instead of going all the way to arbitrary polyhedra, we can get some

mileage by restricting ourselves to arbitrary convex polyhedra.

Any such

object can be represented as a system of linear inequalities, each of which

determines the halfspace bounded by a plane of which a face of the object is
a segment and which is

true on the interior of the object.

Thus the ques-

tion of whether or not two convex polyhedra are disjoint is the same as

the question of when a system of linear inequalities (the union of the systems which determine each object) is inconsistent.

of Michael Rabin,

thought that this problem was very hard, and

I

consider it as a possible approach.

Dr. Rabin, however, showed me that one

could consider this a linear programming problem as follows:

Let two con-

vex polyhedra P and Q be represented by the following inequalities, where
f £-0 (f i«0) is the equation of the ith face of p (q).

Since P is an object, it is not inconsistent and must have a solution, say

(Xj.y.^j) which satisfies

it.

Thus we can employ linear programming tech-

niques, the simplex method, for example, to find a solution of P which optimizes the form f

over fft j>p).

as follows:

When we choose

to a side of Q to increase with respect to the

are both satisfied everywhere on P.

The algorithm which

hacks and thus does not waste time with irrelevancies.

The only real over-

head is that it carries EF and FG along throughout the calculations because

do not know how to decide that they are subsumed by

P.

Why have we gone to so much trouble to find a clever method for
determining the disjointness of objects; surely we can do this simply by
analytic geometry?

If two objects intersect such that one is not wholly

contained within the other, then an edge of one must intersect a face of
the other.

The straightforward way to check this is to determine the

intersection of every edge of one with every face of the other by solving
three simultaneous equations in three unknowns {two defining the edge and
the third, the face) and then checking that the resulting point is in
the correct range.

(By Cramer's rule, a 3x3 set

of equations takes four

determinants, each taking 14 operations; but by collecting common subexpressions, this can be reduced to a total of 47 operations.)

Thus,

since a brick has six faces and twelve edges, this method would require
(plus a check that one vertex of each is not in the other

144 such tests

to exclude the wholly contained case) to determine that two bricks are

disjoint.

If they arc not disjoint tho condition wouid be determined

earlier by some particular edge intersecting a particular face in range.

In

the worst case, however, this test would require more than 144x47*6768
operations (we have ignored the range tests) to prove two bricks disjoint.

The linear programming method should take about n iterations, for n
the number of constraints, to determine feasibility.

Now each iteration is

a Jordan elimination on an nx(d+l) matrix, where d is the dimension of
space.

A Jordan elimination takes (n-l)xd subtractions and 2x(n-l)xd

multiplications for a total of 3x(n-l)xd operations.

So for bricks,

FEASGEM should take about 3x11x3x12-1188 operations to determine disjointness.

Though

I

don't know about the worst case, the data on FEASGEN, as

explained in the appendix, seems to indicate that the worst case is when
the objects are disjoint, which takes almost a constant amount of time

to compute, whereas the amount of time it takes to decide that two objects
are not disjoint is always less and varies considerably, just as in the

exhaustive intersection method examined earlier.

This would lead me to

surmise, since the observed behavior of PBASGBN matches the a priori

behavior of the unwritten exhaustive search, that FEASGEN is really only
a

very clever bookkeeping method for doing the exhaustive search, with

built-in range-testing and wholly-within case exclusion.
Nick Horn and

I

have slightly investigated other methods.

For ex-

ample, we have conjectured, but not proved, that any two disjoint convex

polyhedra can be separated by a plane determined by a vertex of one and
an edge of the other.

Since it is easy to determine if two po ins are

on the same side of a plane, this may be a useful technique, but we are
not yet convinced.

Appendix:

A Comparison of RCLEAR and SIMPCLEAR*

Besides implementing RCLHAR and SIMPCLEAR,

I

also implemented a testing

procedure to sake it possible to compare their behavior.

The testing pro-

gram generates a brick with a random length, width, depth, position, and
orientation in a sharply delimited cubical space.
and SIMPCLEAR to this brick.

It

then applies RCLtAR

If they disagree, the program types out an

error message and halts until told to proceed.

If they agree that the

nw

brick is not ciear of other bricks in the space, it repeats the process.
If they agree that the new brick is clear of all other bricks in the space,
it inserts the new brick into the space and repeats.

Since both RCLEAR and

SIMPCLEAR work by testing the pairwise disjointness of their argument and
the bricks in the Model, a comnon parameter which may be used to analyze
the performance of the program is the average time per pairwise comparison

of two bricks during the verification process.
The programs were written in LISP and run interpretively (due to the
fact that the compiler often produces hard-to-find bugs, programs are not

worth compiling unless they are to be run many times so that the time saved
justifies the resultant extra debugging time).

They therefore ran with a

•onstrous overhead (especially since they spend ouch of their time numbercrunching) and the time per brick-pair comparison ranged from

.1

to 10 sec.

RCLEAR had much better best cases and much worse worst cases in general than
SIMPCLEAR.

Furthermore, as space filled up with bricks, RCLEAR became better

and better with respect to SIMPCLEAR.

If the

new brick was destined to be

discovered clear, it is likely that RCLEAR would spend less than .3 sec.
finding that out.

This is probably due to thfi fact that RCLEAR hardly

blinks an eyelash at a brick far away because

it

will be flushed without

any recursion, allowing RCLEAR to concentrate on the more difficult, close*
by cases.

Sometimes, however, a bad case can happen in which RCLEAR re*

curses for a long time.

These cases, however, are rare, and tend to get

averaged out when the number of bricks is large.
tiore

They also tend to happen

often when the brick is to be rejected rather than accepted.

This

tends to suggest that the circumscribed spheres buy more than the inscribed

spheres per recursion,

I

think that because SIMPCLEAR does more arithmetic

than RCLEAR it was hurt more by LISP inefficiency and that if both were hand*

compiled into MIDAS, SIMPCLEAR would be much more competitive.

Perhaps the

best algorithm would combine the two ideas, using the spheres to weed out

obvious cases and turning over tough nuts to FEA5GEN.
